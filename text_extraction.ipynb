Business \\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n \\nLincoln National Corporation (“LNC,” which also may be referred to as “Lincoln,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company, which \\noperates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies.  Through our business segments, we sell a wide \\nrange of wealth protection, accumulation, group protection and retirement income products and solutions.  LNC was organized under \\nthe laws of the state of Indiana in 1968.  We currently maintain our principal executive ofﬁces in Radnor, Pennsylvania.  “Lincoln \\nFinancial Group” is the marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies.  \\n \\nWe provide products and services and report results through four segments as follows:\\n    \\n  \\nBusiness Segments  \\nLife Insurance  \\nAnnuities  \\nGroup Protection  \\nRetirement Plan Services \\n \\nWe also have Other Operations, which includes the ﬁnancial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  \\n \\nThe results of Lincoln Financial Network (“LFN”) and Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”), our retail and wholesale distributors, \\nrespectively, are included in the segments for which they distribute products.  LFD distributes our individual products and services, \\nretirement plans and corporate-owned universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance (“COLI”) and bank-owned universal \\nlife insurance and variable universal life insurance (“BOLI”) products and services.  The distribution occurs primarily through \\nconsultants, brokers, planners, agents, ﬁnancial advisers, third-party administrators (“TPAs”) and other intermediaries.  Group \\nProtection distributes its products and services primarily through employee beneﬁt brokers, TPAs and other employee beneﬁt ﬁrms.  As \\nof December\\xa031, 2022, LFD had approximately 510 internal and external wholesalers (including sales and relationship managers).  As \\nof December\\xa031, 2022, LFN offered LNC and non-proprietary products and advisory services through a national network of \\napproximately 11,900 active producers who placed business with us within the last 24 months.\\n \\nFinancial information in the tables that follow is presented in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated.  We provide revenues, income (loss) from operations and assets attributable to each \\nof our business segments and Other Operations in Note 21.  \\n \\n \\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS\\n \\nLIFE INSURANCE\\n \\nOverview\\n \\nThe Life Insurance segment focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients by providing life insurance products, \\nincluding term insurance, both single (including universal life insurance (“UL”), COLI and BOLI) and survivorship versions of indexed \\nuniversal life insurance (“IUL”) and variable universal life insurance (“VUL”) products, linked-beneﬁt products (which are UL and \\nVUL with riders providing for long-term care costs), and critical illness and long-term care riders, which can be attached to IUL or \\nVUL policies.  Some of our products include secondary guarantees, which are discussed more fully below.  Generally, this segment has \\nhigher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being the strongest.  \\n \\nLife products can be classiﬁed as “ﬁxed” (including indexed) or “variable” contracts.  These classiﬁcations describe whether we or the \\ncontract holders bear the primary investment risk of the assets supporting the policy.  This also determines the manner in which we earn \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 5/324 \\n130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 6/324Table of Contents\\n \\ninvestment margin proﬁts from these products, either as investment spreads for ﬁxed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable \\nproducts.  \\n \\nIn general, the Life Insurance segment’s sources of revenue include premium payments, cost of insurance assessments, expense and fee \\ncharges and investment income.  In turn, this segment incurs expenses, which include paying death claims, long-term care claims, and \\nsurrender beneﬁts, crediting interest, accruing reserves for future claim payments, as well as other expenses related to the business.  The \\ndifference between revenue collected and expenses incurred is the proﬁt for the Life Insurance business.  Proﬁtability, including \\nﬂuctuations from period to period, is impacted by factors such as changes in sales of products, mortality experience (the frequency and \\nmagnitude of mortality claims paid during a given period), persistency and investment income.  The impact of each factor varies by \\nproduct type.  \\n \\nProducts \\n \\nWe offer four categories of life insurance products, consisting of: \\n \\nUL and IUL\\n \\nUL insurance products provide life insurance with account values that earn rates of return solely based on company-declared interest \\nrates.  Contract holder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment \\nperformance.  During 2022, we discontinued new sales of UL products with secondary guarantees.  We continue to offer ﬁxed IUL \\nproducts that function similarly to a traditional UL policy, with the added ﬂexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions of \\ntheir account values earn credits based on the performance of indexes such as the S&P 500® Index.  These products include Lincoln \\nWealthPreserve® IUL and Lincoln WealthAccumulate® IUL.\\n \\nIn a UL contract, contract holders typically have ﬂexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death \\nbeneﬁt, provided there is sufﬁcient account value to cover all policy charges for cost of insurance and expenses for the coming period.  \\nUnder certain contract holder options and market conditions, the death beneﬁt amount may increase or decrease.  Premiums received on \\na UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract holder’s account value and accrued with interest.  The client \\nhas access to their account value (or a portion thereof), less surrender charges and policy loan payoffs, through contractual liquidity \\nfeatures such as loans, partial withdrawals and full surrenders.  Loans and withdrawals reduce the death beneﬁt amount payable and are \\nlimited to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law), and interest is charged on all loans.  Our UL \\ncontracts assess surrender charges against the policies’ account values for full or partial surrenders and certain policy changes that occur \\nduring the contractual surrender charge period.  Depending on the product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 0 to 25 \\nyears.\\n \\nAs mentioned previously, we offer a survivorship version of our individual IUL products, Lincoln WealthPreserve® SIUL.  This \\nproduct insures two lives with a single policy and pays death beneﬁts upon the second death.  \\n \\nA UL policy with a lifetime secondary guarantee can stay in force, even if the base policy cash value is zero, as long as secondary \\nguarantee requirements have been met.  The secondary guarantee requirement is based on the payment of a required minimum premium \\nor on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value, but using \\ndifferent expense charges, cost of insurance charges and credited interest rates.  The parameters for the secondary guarantee \\nrequirement are listed in the contract.  As long as the contract holder pays the minimum premium or funds the policy to a level that \\nkeeps this calculated reference value positive, the policy is guaranteed to stay in force.  The reference value has no actual monetary \\nvalue to the contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy \\ncash value be less than zero.  \\n \\nVUL\\n \\nVUL products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of variable funds \\noffered through the product.  The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account is driven by the performance of the \\nunderlying variable funds chosen by the contract holder.  As the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, that portion \\nof the account value of the VUL policy will increase or decrease.  In addition, VUL products offer a ﬁxed account option that is \\nmanaged by us.  As with ﬁxed UL products, contract holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through \\nloans, withdrawals and surrenders.  Surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period, ranging from 0 to 20 years \\ndepending on the product.  Our single life VUL offerings include Lincoln AssetEdge® VUL and Lincoln VULONE insurance products.  \\nOur COLI products are also VUL-type products.\\n \\nWe also offer a survivorship version of our individual VUL products, Lincoln SVULONE.  This product insures two lives with a single \\npolicy and pays death beneﬁts upon the second death.  \\n \\n \\n \\n230/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 7/32430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 8/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nWe offer lifetime guaranteed beneﬁt riders with our Lincoln VULONE and Lincoln SVULONE products.  The ONE rider features \\nguarantee to the contract holder that upon death, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met, the death beneﬁt will be \\npayable even if the account value equals zero.\\n \\nOur secondary guarantee beneﬁts maintain the ﬂexibility of a UL or VUL policy, which allow a contract holder to take loans or \\nwithdrawals.  Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the secondary guarantee, the guarantee is not \\nautomatically or completely forfeited.  Additional premium may be deposited to extend the length of the guarantee.  For additional \\ninformation on our reserves on UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees, see Note 10.\\n \\nLinked-Beneﬁt Life Products and Products with Critical Illness Riders \\n \\nLincoln MoneyGuard®, our linked-beneﬁt life product group, combines UL or VUL with long-term care insurance through the use of a \\nrider or riders.  The policy rider allows the contract holder to accelerate death beneﬁts on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualiﬁed \\nlong-term care need, reducing the remaining death beneﬁt, and, once the death beneﬁt is exhausted, offers access to an additional pool \\nof dollars that can be used for qualiﬁed long-term care expenses.  Certain policies also provide a reduced death beneﬁt to the contract \\nholder’s beneﬁciary if the death beneﬁt has been fully accelerated as long-term care beneﬁts during the contract holder’s life.\\n \\nSome life products provide for critical illness or long-term care insurance by the use of riders attached to IUL or VUL policies.  These \\nriders allow the contract holder to accelerate death beneﬁts on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualiﬁed condition. \\n \\nTerm Life Insurance\\n \\nTerm life insurance provides a ﬁxed death beneﬁt for a scheduled period of time.  Some of our term life insurance products give the \\ncontract holder the option to reduce the death beneﬁt at a future time.  Scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least \\nannually.  These products include Lincoln TermAccel® Level Term and Lincoln LifeElements® Level Term. \\n \\nDistribution \\n \\nThe Life Insurance segment’s products are sold through LFD.  LFD provides the Life Insurance segment with access to ﬁnancial \\nintermediaries in the following primary distribution channels:  wire/regional ﬁrms; independent planner ﬁrms (including LFN); \\nﬁnancial institutions; and managing general agents/independent marketing organizations.  LFD distributes BOLI/COLI products and \\nservices to banks and mid- to large-sized corporations, primarily through intermediaries who specialize in one or both of these markets \\nand who are serviced through a network of internal and external LFD sales professionals.\\n \\nCompetition  \\n \\nThe life insurance market is very competitive and consists of many companies with no one company dominating the market for all \\nproducts.  Principal competitive factors include product features, price, underwriting and issue process, customer service and insurers’ \\nﬁnancial strength.  With our broad distribution network, we compete in the three primary needs of life insurance:  death beneﬁt \\nprotection, accumulation and linked beneﬁts (MoneyGuard).  In addition, we use automated underwriting within a deﬁned criteria as \\nwell as LincXpress®, a streamlined issue process, both of which are seen as marketplace competitive advantages. \\n \\nUnderwriting \\n \\nIn the context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non-medical information about an individual and \\ndetermining the effect these factors statistically have on mortality.  This process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classiﬁcation.  \\nNo one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated \\nduring the underwriting process. \\n \\nClaims Administration \\n \\nClaims service is handled primarily in-house, and claims examiners are assigned to each claim notiﬁcation based on coverage amount, \\ntype of claim and the experience of the examiner.  Claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claims examiners.  A formal \\nquality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities.  A network of in-\\nhouse legal counsel, compliance ofﬁcers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claims examiners.  A \\nspecial team of claims examiners, in conjunction with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as claims \\nincurred during the contestable period, beneﬁciary disputes and litigated claims.  Long-term care claims are handled primarily by a \\nthird-party administrator.  \\n \\n \\n330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 9/324Table of Contents\\n \\nANNUITIES\\n \\nOverview\\n \\nThe Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering variable \\nannuities, ﬁxed (including indexed) annuities and indexed variable annuities.  Similar to the life insurance product classiﬁcations \\ndescribed above, the “ﬁxed” and “variable” classiﬁcations describe whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the \\nassets supporting the contract.  With “indexed variable” annuities, the extent to which we or the contract holders bear the investment \\nrisk of the assets is based on the investment allocations.  The annuity classiﬁcation also determines the manner in which we earn \\ninvestment margin proﬁts from these products, either as investment spreads for ﬁxed products, as asset-based fees charged to variable \\nproducts, or as both for indexed variable products. \\n \\nAnnuities have several features that are attractive to customers.  Annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a variety of \\npayout alternatives to provide an income ﬂow for life.  Many annuity contracts also include guarantee features (living and death \\nbeneﬁts) that are not found in any other investment vehicle and that, we believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of \\neconomic uncertainty.  In addition, growth on the underlying principal in annuities is typically granted tax-deferred treatment, thereby \\ndeferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, potentially at lower tax \\nrates occurring during retirement.\\n \\nProducts \\n \\nIn general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual in which the insurance company, after receipt of \\none or more premium payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-\\nannually, quarterly or monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as speciﬁed in the contract or as \\nrequested.  Periodic payments can begin within 12 months after the premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a \\nfuture date in time (referred to as a deferred annuity).  This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving their money. \\n \\nVariable Annuities \\n \\nA variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one or more variable sub-\\naccounts (“variable funds”) offered through the product (“variable portion”) and, for a speciﬁed period, into a ﬁxed account (if \\navailable) with a guaranteed return (“ﬁxed portion”).  The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account varies with the \\nperformance of the underlying variable funds chosen by the contract holder.  \\n \\nOur variable funds include the Managed Risk Strategies fund options, a series of funds that embed volatility risk management and, with \\nsome funds, capital protection strategies inside the funds themselves.  These funds seek to reduce equity market volatility risk for both \\nthe contract holder and us.  \\n \\nWe charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and \\nadministrative expenses.  These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units \\nowned for any variable fund equals the contract holder’s account value for that variable fund.  In addition, for some contracts, we \\nimpose surrender charges, which are typically applicable to withdrawals during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining \\nlevel of surrender charges over time.\\n \\nWe offer guaranteed beneﬁt riders with certain of our variable annuity products, such as a guaranteed death beneﬁt (“GDB”), a \\nguaranteed withdrawal beneﬁt (“GWB”), a guaranteed income beneﬁt (“GIB”) and a combination of such beneﬁts.  \\n \\nThe GDB features offered include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, depending on the \\nparticular product, we will return no less than:  the current contract value; the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reﬂect any \\npartial withdrawals; the highest contract value on a speciﬁed anniversary date adjusted to reﬂect any partial withdrawals following the \\ncontract anniversary; or an earnings enhancement on gains in the contract.\\n \\nWe offer the optional Lincoln ProtectedPaySM lifetime income suite, which provides a GWB and includes:  Secure Core, Secure Plus \\nand Secure Max, and Select Core, Select Plus and Select Max.  All provide contract holders with protected lifetime income that is based \\non a maximum rate of the income base that grows annually for a speciﬁed period of time at the greater of a speciﬁed simple rate or \\naccount value growth.  The riders provide higher income if the contract holder delays withdrawals.  The Secure Core and Select Core \\nriders are hybrid beneﬁt riders combining aspects of GWB and GIB that provide a speciﬁed maximum rate of income.  The Secure Plus \\nand Secure Max riders and Select Plus and Select Max riders provide contract holders with protected lifetime income up to a speciﬁed \\nmaximum rate of the income base and a lower speciﬁed maximum rate of the income base if the account value falls to zero.  Contract \\nholders under the Secure riders are subject to the allocation of their account value to our Managed Risk Strategies fund options and \\ncertain ﬁxed-income options.  Contract holders under the Select riders are subject to restrictions on the allocation of their account value \\nwithin the various investment choices.\\n \\n \\n430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 10/32430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 11/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nWe also offer the American Legacy® Target Date Income variable annuity with an optional Target Date Income Beneﬁt rider, which \\ncombines target date investing with a protected lifetime income.  Contract holders who elect the Target Date Income Beneﬁt are \\nautomatically allocated to the Target Date Fund based on their year of birth.  The protected lifetime income is based on a percentage \\nrate of income for their age at the time of purchase of the optional rider, which will grow at the greater of a speciﬁed simple rate \\n(available each year a withdrawal is not taken for a speciﬁed period of time) or account value growth.\\n \\nIn addition, we offer the i4LIFE® Advantage and i4LIFE Advantage Guaranteed Income Beneﬁt (Managed Risk) riders.  These riders \\nallow variable annuity contract holders access and control during a portion of the income distribution phase of their contract.  In \\ngeneral, GIB is an optional feature available with the i4LIFE Advantage rider and a non-optional feature on the i4LIFE Advantage \\nGuaranteed Income Beneﬁt (Managed Risk) rider that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below the greater of a \\nminimum income ﬂoor set at beneﬁt issue and 75% of the highest income payment on a speciﬁed anniversary date (reduced for any \\nsubsequent withdrawals).  Contract holders under the i4LIFE Advantage Guaranteed Income Beneﬁt (Managed Risk) rider are subject \\nto the allocation of their account value to our Managed Risk Strategies fund options and certain ﬁxed-income options.  \\n \\nWe also offer the 4LATER® Select Advantage rider.  This rider provides a minimum income base used to determine the GIB ﬂoor \\nwhen a client begins income payments under the i4LIFE Advantage Select Guaranteed Income Beneﬁt rider.  The 4LATER Select \\nAdvantage rider provides growth during the accumulation phase through both an enhancement to the income base each year a \\nwithdrawal is not taken for a speciﬁed period of time and an annual step-up of the income base to the current contract value.  Contract \\nholders under the 4LATER Select Advantage rider are subject to restrictions on the allocation of their account value within the various \\ninvestment choices.\\n \\nWe design and actively manage the features and structure of our guaranteed beneﬁt riders to maintain a competitive suite of products \\nconsistent with proﬁtability and risk management goals.  We use a variety of hedging strategies to mitigate the risks to the statutory \\ncapital of our insurance subsidiaries associated with our guaranteed beneﬁt riders.  For more information on our hedging program, see \\n“Introduction – Executive Summary – Signiﬁcant Operational Matters – Variable Annuity Hedge Program” in the MD&A.  For \\ninformation regarding risks related to our guaranteed beneﬁts and hedging strategies, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – \\nChanges in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the proﬁtability of our products with guaranteed beneﬁts; therefore, \\nsuch changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and proﬁtability,” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions –  \\nOur hedging strategies may not be fully effective to offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees on certain of our \\nproducts, which could result in volatility in our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition under GAAP and in the capital levels of our \\ninsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.”\\n \\nFixed Annuities \\n \\nA ﬁxed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the \\naccumulation value.  Our ﬁxed annuity product offerings consist of traditional ﬁxed-rate and ﬁxed indexed deferred annuities, as well \\nas ﬁxed-rate immediate and deferred income annuities with various payment options, including lifetime incomes.  Fixed annuity \\ncontracts are general account obligations.  We bear the investment risk for ﬁxed annuity contracts.  To protect from premature \\nwithdrawals, we impose surrender charges.  Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, \\nwith a declining level of surrender charges over time.  On most policies, within the surrender charge period, we also have a market \\nvalue adjustment provision that protects us against disintermediation risk in the case of rapidly rising interest rates.  We expect to earn a \\nspread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the ﬁxed annuity product line and what we \\ncredit to our ﬁxed annuity contract holders’ accounts.\\n \\nWe offer single and ﬂexible premium ﬁxed deferred annuities.  Single premium ﬁxed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a \\nsingle premium to be paid.  Flexible premium ﬁxed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium payments, subject to \\ncontractual limits, on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis.  \\n \\nOur ﬁxed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to choose between a ﬁxed interest crediting rate and an indexed interest crediting \\nrate, which is based on the performance of the S&P 500® Index, the S&P 500 Daily Risk Control 5%TM Index, the S&P 500 Daily \\nRisk Control 10%TM Index, the J.P. Morgan First Trust Balanced Capital Strength 6SM Index, the J.P. Morgan First Trust Balanced \\nCapital Strength 5SM Index, the BlackRock Dynamic Allocation Index, or the Fidelity AIMSM Dividend Index.  The indexed interest \\ncredit is guaranteed never to be less than zero.  \\n \\nWe use derivatives to hedge the equity market risk associated with our ﬁxed indexed annuity products.  For more information on our \\nhedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A.\\n \\nIndexed Variable Annuities\\n \\nLincoln Level Advantage® is our indexed variable annuity product, which is commonly referred to in the industry as a registered index-\\nlinked annuity.   Lincoln Level Advantage provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one \\nor more variable funds and/or indexed accounts offered through the product.  The value of the variable sub-accounts varies with the \\nperformance of the underlying variable funds chosen by the contract holder.  The index interest crediting rate for an indexed account is 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 12/324 \\n \\n530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 13/324Table of Contents\\n \\nbased, in part, on the performance of an index.  The available indices are the S&P 500® Index, the Russell 2000® Index, the MSCI \\nEAFE, the Capital Strength Net Fee IndexSM, the First Trust American Leadership IndexTM and the NASDAQ-100 Index®.  \\n \\nWe charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on the variable funds to cover insurance and administrative \\nexpenses.  These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any \\nvariable fund equals the contract holder’s account value for that variable fund.  In addition, for some contracts, we impose surrender \\ncharges, which are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over \\ntime.\\n \\nWe offer a GDB rider where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, depending on the particular product, we \\nwill return no less than the current contract value or the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reﬂect any partial withdrawals.\\n \\nWe also offer the i4LIFE® Advantage rider.  This rider allows annuity contract holders access and control during a portion of the \\nincome distribution phase of their contract.  This added ﬂexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for transfers \\nand additional withdrawals.  \\n \\nWe use derivatives to hedge the equity market risk associated with our indexed variable annuity products.  For more information on our \\nhedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A.\\n \\nDistribution  \\n \\nThe Annuities segment distributes its individual ﬁxed and variable annuity products through LFD.  LFD’s distribution channels give the \\nAnnuities segment access to its target markets.  LFD distributes the segment’s products to a large number of ﬁnancial intermediaries, \\nincluding LFN.  The ﬁnancial intermediaries include wire/regional ﬁrms, independent ﬁnancial planners, ﬁnancial institutions, \\nregistered investment advisers and managing general agents.\\n \\nCompetition \\n \\nThe annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no one company dominating the market for all \\nproducts.  The Annuities segment competes with numerous other ﬁnancial services companies.  The main factors upon which entities in \\nthis market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, breadth of product \\nportfolio and features, speed to market, brand recognition, ﬁnancial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.\\n \\nGROUP PROTECTION\\n \\nOverview\\n \\nThe Group Protection segment offers group non-medical insurance products and services, including short- and long-term disability, \\nstatutory disability and paid family medical leave administration and absence management services, term life, dental, vision and \\naccident, critical illness and hospital indemnity beneﬁts and services to the employer marketplace through various forms of employee-\\npaid and employer-paid plans.  Group Protection markets its products and services to employer groups of all sizes, from small \\ncompanies with fewer than 100 employees to large employers with 10,000 or more employees, with enhanced disability and absence \\nmanagement competency.\\n \\nProducts\\n \\nDisability Insurance and Services\\n \\nWe offer insured coverage for, as well as administrative services for employer self-funded, short- and long-term employer-sponsored \\ngroup and voluntary disability insurance, which protects an employee against loss of wages due to illness or injury.  Short-term \\ndisability insurance generally provides weekly beneﬁts for up to 26 weeks following a short waiting period, ranging from 1 to 30 days.  \\nLong-term disability insurance provides beneﬁts following a longer waiting period, usually between 90 and 180 days, and provides \\nbeneﬁts for a longer period, ranging from 2 years to normal (Social Security) retirement age.  The monthly beneﬁts provided are subject \\nto reduction when Social Security beneﬁts are also paid.  We also provide insured coverage for, as well as administrative services for \\nemployer self-funded, state-speciﬁc statutory disability and paid family leave programs as legislation is passed and implemented.   \\n \\nAbsence Management\\n \\nWe offer a robust portfolio of absence management services to help employers manage their state and federal family medical and \\ncompany leave programs (paid and unpaid), as well as accommodation services that help employers identify accommodations that \\ncould be made to help claimants return to work (e.g., assistive devices, ergonomic assessments, etc.).  Our comprehensive and \\ncompliant solutions, with ease of intake, provide coordinated and integrated management expertise to handle both leave and disability \\nevents.\\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 14/324 \\n630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 15/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nLife Insurance \\n \\nWe offer employer-sponsored group term life insurance products including basic, optional, and voluntary term life insurance to \\nemployees and their dependents.  Additional beneﬁts may be provided in the event of a covered individual’s accidental death or \\ndismemberment.  \\n \\nDental and Vision \\n \\nWe offer a variety of employer-sponsored group dental insurance plans, which cover a portion of the cost of eligible dental procedures \\nfor employees and their dependents.  Products offered include:  indemnity coverage, which does not distinguish beneﬁts based on a \\ndental provider’s participation in a network arrangement; Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”) products, on an insured and \\nadministrative services only basis, that do reﬂect the dental provider’s participation in the PPO network arrangement, including an \\nagreement with network fee schedules; a Dental Health Maintenance Organization product that limits beneﬁt coverage to a closed panel \\nof network providers; an in-network-only option that limits beneﬁt coverage to providers in certain states; and self-funded options for \\ngroups with more than 200 employees.\\n \\nWe offer comprehensive employer-sponsored fully insured vision plans with a wide range of beneﬁts for protecting employees’ and \\ntheir covered dependents’ sight and vision health.  All plans provide access to a national network of providers, with in and out-of-\\nnetwork beneﬁts. \\n \\nAccident, Critical Illness and Hospital Indemnity Insurance\\n \\nWe offer employer-sponsored group accident insurance products for employees and their covered dependents.  This product is \\npredominantly purchased on an employee-paid basis.  Accident insurance provides scheduled beneﬁts for over 30 types of beneﬁt \\ntriggers related to accidental causes, including sports-related injuries, and is available for non-occupational accidents exclusively or on \\na 24-hour coverage basis.\\n \\nWe also offer employer-sponsored group critical illness insurance to employees and their covered dependents.  This product is \\npredominantly purchased on an employee-paid basis.  The coverage provides for lump sum payouts upon the occurrence of one of the \\nspeciﬁed critical illness beneﬁt triggers covered within a critical illness insurance policy.  This product also includes beneﬁts and \\nservices that assist employees and their family members in the prevention, early detection and treatment of critical illness events.\\n \\nWe also offer hospital indemnity insurance as part of our suite of supplemental health solutions.  Similar to our employer-sponsored \\ngroup accident and critical illness insurance, hospital indemnity is offered to employees and their covered dependents and is \\npredominantly purchased on an employee-paid basis.  Hospital indemnity insurance provides scheduled beneﬁts for hospital admission \\nand daily conﬁnement, as well as over 20 beneﬁt triggers related to hospitalization due to an accident and/or illness.\\n \\nDistribution\\n \\nThe Group Protection segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system.  The managers and marketing \\nrepresentatives develop business through employee beneﬁt brokers, consultants, TPAs and other employee beneﬁt ﬁrms that work with \\nemployers to provide access to our products.\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nThe group protection marketplace is very competitive.  Principal competitive factors include product features, price, quality of \\ncustomer service and claims management, technological capabilities, quality and efﬁciency of distribution and ﬁnancial strength \\nratings.  In this market, the Group Protection segment competes nationally with a number of major companies and regionally with other \\ncompanies offering all or some of the products within our product set.  In addition, there is competition in attracting brokers to actively \\nmarket our products and attracting and retaining sales representatives to sell our products.  Key competitive factors in attracting brokers \\ninclude product offerings and features, ﬁnancial strength, support services and compensation.   \\n \\nUnderwriting\\n \\nThe Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk characteristics of each employer group.  Generally, the relevant \\ncharacteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age, gender, income and occupation), employer industry \\nclassiﬁcation, geographic location, beneﬁt design elements and other factors.  The segment employs detailed underwriting policies, \\nguidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks.  Individual underwriting techniques \\n(including evaluation of individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered individuals selecting beneﬁt amounts \\nthat are above guarantee issue limits set forth in the insurance policies.  For voluntary and other forms of employee paid coverages, \\nminimum participation requirements are used to obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of anti-selection.\\n \\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 16/324730/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 17/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nClaims Administration\\n \\nClaims for the Group Protection segment are managed by in-house claim specialists.  Claims are evaluated for eligibility and payment \\nof beneﬁts pursuant to the group insurance contract or self-insured plan and in compliance with federal and state regulations.  Efﬁcient \\nand accurate disability claims management is especially important to customer service satisfaction and segment results.  Results can be \\nimpacted by both the incidence and the length of approved disability claims.  The segment employs a variety of clinical experts, \\nincluding employee and contract medical professionals and rehabilitation specialists, to evaluate medically supported functional \\ncapabilities and to assist in the development of return to work plans.  The accuracy and speed of life claims are important customer \\nservice and risk management factors.  Some life policies include a waiver of premium provision in the event of the insured’s disability.  \\nDental claims management focuses on assisting plan administrators and members with the rising costs of insurance by utilizing tools to \\noptimize dental claims payment accuracy through advanced claims review and validation, improved data analysis, enhanced clinical \\nreview of claims and provider utilization monitoring.\\n \\nRETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES\\n \\nOverview\\n \\nThe Retirement Plan Services segment provides employers with retirement plan products and services, primarily in the deﬁned \\ncontribution retirement plan marketplace.  Deﬁned contribution plans are a popular employee beneﬁt offered by employers large and \\nsmall across a wide spectrum of industries.  While our focus is employer-sponsored deﬁned contribution plans, we also serve the \\ndeﬁned beneﬁt plan and individual retirement account (“IRA”) markets on a limited basis.  We provide a variety of plan investment \\nvehicles, including individual and group variable annuities, group ﬁxed annuities and mutual fund-based programs.  We also offer a \\nbroad array of plan services including plan recordkeeping, compliance testing, participant education and trust and custodial services \\nthrough our afﬁliated trust company, Lincoln Financial Group Trust Company.  \\n \\nProducts and Services\\n \\nThe Retirement Plan Services segment currently brings three primary offerings to the employer-sponsored market:  LINCOLN \\nDIRECTORSM group variable annuity, LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program and Multi-Fund® variable annuity.  The LINCOLN \\nALLIANCE program is a mutual fund-based record-keeping platform.  These offerings primarily cover the 403(b), 401(k) and 457 plan \\nmarketplaces.  The 403(b) plans are available to educational institutions, not-for-proﬁt healthcare organizations and certain other not-\\nfor-proﬁt entities; 401(k) plans are generally available to for-proﬁt entities; and 457 plans are available to not-for-proﬁt entities and \\nstate and local government entities.  The investment options for our annuities encompass the spectrum of asset classes with varying \\nlevels of risk and include both equity and ﬁxed-income.  \\n \\nLINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity is a 401(k) deﬁned contribution retirement plan solution available to small \\nbusinesses, typically those with plans having less than $10 million in account values.  The LINCOLN DIRECTOR product offers \\nparticipants a broad array of investment options from several fund families and a ﬁxed account.  The Retirement Plan Services segment \\nearns revenue through asset charges and/or separate account charges, which are used to pay our fees for recordkeeping services.  We \\nalso receive fees from the underlying mutual fund companies for the services we provide, and we earn investment margins on assets in \\nthe ﬁxed account.  Through the LINCOLN DIRECTOR product, as well the LINCOLN ALLIANCE® product discussed below, we also \\noffer our proprietary YourPath® portfolios, a series of target-date portfolios for employer-sponsored retirement plans.  These target-date \\nportfolios are managed along multiple risk-based paths to support a more personalized investment approach based upon ﬁnancial \\ncircumstances and risk tolerance.  These target-date portfolios are also available with an income solution in the form of a GWB.  \\n \\nThe LINCOLN ALLIANCE program is a deﬁned contribution retirement plan solution aimed at small, mid-large and large market \\nemployers, typically those that have deﬁned contribution plans with $10 million or more in account value.  The target market is \\nprimarily healthcare providers, public sector employers, corporations and educational institutions.  The program bundles our traditional \\nﬁxed annuity products with the employer’s choice of mutual funds, along with recordkeeping, plan compliance services and customized \\nemployee education services.  The program allows the use of any mutual fund.  We earn fees for our recordkeeping and educational \\nservices and other services that we provide to plan sponsors and participants.  We also earn investment margins on ﬁxed annuities.  \\n \\nMulti-Fund® variable annuity is a deﬁned contribution retirement plan solution with fully bundled administrative services and \\ninvestment choices for small- to mid-sized healthcare, education, governmental and not-for-proﬁt employers sponsoring 403(b), 457(b) \\nand 401(a)/(k) plans.  The product is available to the employer through the Multi-Fund group variable annuity contract or directly to the \\nindividual participant through the Multi-Fund Select variable annuity contract.  We earn mortality and expense charges, investment \\nincome on the ﬁxed account and surrender charges from this product.  We also receive fees for services that we provide to funds in the \\nunderlying separate accounts. \\n \\n \\n \\n830/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 18/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nAdditionally, we offer other products and services that complement our primary offerings:\\n \\n\\x00The Lincoln Next Step® series of products is a suite of mutual fund-based IRAs available exclusively for participants in Lincoln-\\nserviced retirement plans and their spouses.  The products can accept rollovers and transfers from other providers as well as \\nongoing contributions.  The Lincoln Next Step IRA product has no annual account charges and offers an array of mutual fund \\ninvestment options provided by 20 fund families all offered at net asset value.  The Lincoln Next Step Select IRA has an annual \\nrecord keeping charge and offers an even wider array of mutual fund investment options from over 20 families, all at net asset \\nvalue.  We earn 12b-1 and service fees on the mutual funds within the product.\\n\\x00Through a group annuity contract, we offer a series of products intended to fulﬁll future needs of retirement security for our clients.  \\nBy offering a GWB inside a retirement plan, we provide plan sponsors a solution that gives participants the ability to participate in \\nthe market and receive guaranteed income for life while still maintaining access to their plan account value.  These products are \\navailable both to retirement plans where we provide plan recordkeeping services and those where we do not.\\n\\x00Through a group annuity contract or funding agreement, we offer ﬁxed return products to retirement plans and other institutional \\ncontract holders where we do not provide plan recordkeeping services.  The ﬁxed annuity or funding agreement is used within \\nsmall, mid-large and large employer plan sponsors or institutional investors.  The contract provides a conservative investment \\noption for those seeking stability.  In some cases, we earn investment margins on assets in the ﬁxed account, and in other product \\nversions we earn a fee on assets in the underlying custodial account.  \\n \\nDistribution \\n \\nRetirement Plan Services products are primarily distributed in two ways:  through our Institutional Retirement Distribution team and by \\nLFD.  Wholesalers distribute these products through advisers, consultants, banks, wirehouses and individual planners.  We remain \\nfocused on wholesaler productivity, increasing relationship management expertise and growing the number of broker-dealer \\nrelationships. \\n \\nThe Multi-Fund program is sold primarily by afﬁliated advisers.  The LINCOLN ALLIANCE program is sold primarily through \\nconsultants, registered independent advisers and both afﬁliated and non-afﬁliated ﬁnancial advisers, planners and wirehouses.  \\nLINCOLN DIRECTOR group variable annuity is sold in the small marketplace by intermediaries, including ﬁnancial advisers and \\nplanners.\\n \\nCompetition \\n \\nThe retirement plan marketplace is very competitive and comprised of many providers with no one company dominating the market for \\nall products.  As stated above, we compete with numerous other ﬁnancial services corporations in the small, mid and large employer \\nmarkets.  The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are product strength, technology, service model delivery, \\nparticipant education models, quality of wholesale distribution access to intermediary ﬁrms and brand recognition.  Our key \\ndifferentiator is our technology enabled, people-connected service model, which leverages digitally focused tools with personalized \\nsupport and has been shown to drive positive outcomes for plan sponsors and participants.\\n \\nOTHER OPERATIONS\\n \\nOther Operations includes the ﬁnancial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Other Operations \\nincludes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; corporate investments; beneﬁt plan net liability; the \\nresults of certain disability income business; our run-off Institutional Pension business in the form of group annuity and insured \\nfunding-type of contracts; debt; and Spark program expenses.  For more information on the Spark Initiative, see “Introduction – \\nExecutive Summary – Signiﬁcant Operational Matters – Spark Initiative” in the MD&A.\\n \\nREINSURANCE\\n  \\nOur reinsurance strategy is designed to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and \\nunusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss.  Although reinsurance does not \\ndischarge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their contract holders for losses insured under the insurance \\npolicies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  Because we bear \\nthe risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated unafﬁliated \\nreinsurers.  We also utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program \\nfor variable annuity guarantees.  These inter-company agreements do not have an effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2022, the policy for our reinsurance program was to retain up to $20 million on a single insured life.

For example, we use reinsurance to cover larger life and disability claims in our Group \\nProtection business.\\n \\nWe obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and ﬁnancial strength ratings of our principal \\nreinsurers.  Protective, Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Resolution Life that we refer to herein as \\n“Resolution Life”) and Athene Holding Ltd. (“Athene”) represent our largest reinsurance exposures.  For more information regarding \\nour reinsurance arrangements and exposure, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 8.  For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item \\n1A. Risk Factors – Operational Matters – We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which \\ncould materially affect our results of operations.” \\n \\nRESERVES\\n \\nThe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet \\nfuture obligations on their outstanding policies.  These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and \\ninterest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufﬁcient to meet the various policy and contract \\nobligations as they mature.  These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain speciﬁed \\nmortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.  From time to time, the insurance laws, regulations, or \\nregulatory guidance that specify the mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation may be changed or \\ninterpreted differently, which may result in changes in the required reserves of our insurance subsidiaries.  For more information on \\nreserves, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Beneﬁts” and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – \\nOther Contract Holder Funds” in the MD&A.  For information on risks regarding changes in regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – \\nLegislative, Regulatory and Tax – Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement \\npolicies may affect our insurance subsidiary capital requirements, reduce our proﬁtability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely \\naffect our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.”  \\n \\nSee “Regulatory” below for information on permitted practices and proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory \\nreserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities. \\n \\nFor risks related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates \\nmay cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our proﬁtability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory \\nrequirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Operational \\nMatters – We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of \\noperations.”\\n \\nINVESTMENTS\\n \\nAn important component of our ﬁnancial results is the return on investments.  Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current \\nincome with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufﬁcient current income to meet our obligations.  This \\napproach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.  This \\napproach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the \\neconomic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  Investments made by our insurance subsidiaries \\nmust comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile. \\n \\nDerivatives are used primarily for hedging purposes and, to a lesser extent, income generation.  Hedging strategies are employed for a \\nnumber of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in interest rate ﬂuctuations, credit \\nrisks, foreign exchange risks, equity risks and the market-implied volatilities associated with guaranteed beneﬁt riders available in our \\nvariable annuity products.  In September 2022, we announced enhancements to our variable annuity hedge program that continues to \\nfocus on generating sufﬁcient assets to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting \\ncapital.  The revised variable annuity hedge program, effective January 1, 2023, aligns with our increased strategic focus on \\nmaximizing the economic value as measured by distributable earnings, which is achieved by managing risks to capital generation due \\nto market volatility.  For additional information on our investments, including carrying values by category, quality ratings and net \\ninvestment income, see “Consolidated Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 4.

We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our \\noperations.  There may be other rating agencies that also rate our insurance companies, which we do not disclose in our reports. \\n \\nThe insurer ﬁnancial strength rating scales of AM Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P \\nGlobal Ratings (“S&P”) are characterized as follows: \\n \\n\\x00AM Best – A++ to D  \\n\\x00Fitch – AAA to C  \\n\\x00Moody’s – Aaa to C\\n\\x00S&P – AAA to D \\n \\nAs of February\\xa013, 2023, the ﬁnancial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating \\nagencies that rate us, were as follows:\\n \\n          \\n AM Best  Fitch  Moody's S&P  \\n         \\nThe Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) A  A+  A1  A+  \\n (3rd highest of \\n16) (5th highest      \\nof 19) (5th highest \\nof 21) (5th highest of \\n21) \\n \\n         \\nLincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”) A  A+  A1  A+  \\n (3rd highest of \\n16) (5th highest \\nof 19) (5th highest \\nof 21) (5th highest of \\n21) \\n         \\nFirst Penn-Paciﬁc Life Insurance Company (“FPP”) A  A+  A1  A-  \\n (3rd highest of \\n16) (5th highest \\nof 19) (5th highest \\nof 21) (7th highest of \\n21) \\n \\nA downgrade of the ﬁnancial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the \\ninsurance industry and make it more difﬁcult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher \\nﬁnancial strength ratings.  See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our ﬁnancial strength or credit \\nratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our \\nrelationships with creditors.”\\n \\nOur insurer ﬁnancial strength ratings assigned by AM Best and S&P for LNL and LLANY and assigned by S&P for FPP are on outlook \\nstable, and all of our other insurer ﬁnancial strength ratings are on outlook negative.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or \\nwithdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries can \\nmaintain these ratings.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Ratings are not recommendations to buy our \\nsecurities.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Ratings” in the MD&A for a discussion of our credit ratings.\\n \\nREGULATORY\\n \\nInsurance Regulation \\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states, territories and \\ncountries in which they are licensed to do business.  The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that \\ndelegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies.  In the U.S., this power is vested in state \\ninsurance departments. \\n \\nIn supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments, charged primarily with protecting contract holders and \\nthe public rather than investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that \\npurpose.  Our principal insurance subsidiaries, LNL, LLANY and FPP, are domiciled in the states of Indiana, New York and Indiana, \\nrespectively.\\n \\nThe insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries.  The \\nextent of regulation by the states varies, but, in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, \\nadequacy of reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 22/324policy forms, regulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of ﬁnancial statements and reports, \\nregulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct.

Examinations are generally \\ncarried out in cooperation with the insurance regulators of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of \\nInsurance Commissioners (“NAIC”).  State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement \\nagencies and Attorneys General also, from time to time, make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding the \\ncompliance by our company, as well as other companies in our industry, with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws.  \\nOur captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic ﬁnancial examinations by their respective domiciliary state \\ninsurance regulators.  We have not received any material adverse ﬁndings resulting from state insurance department examinations of \\nour insurance, reinsurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries conducted during the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2022.\\n \\nState insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to ﬁle ﬁnancial statements with state insurance departments \\neverywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those \\ndepartments at any time.  Our U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory ﬁnancial statements in accordance with accounting practices \\nand procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.  The NAIC has approved a series of statutory accounting principles \\n(“SAP”) that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modiﬁcations, by virtually all state insurance departments.  Changes in these \\nstatutory accounting principles can signiﬁcantly affect our capital and surplus. \\n \\nIn December 2022, the NAIC approved changes to Actuarial Guideline XLIX (“AG49”) that affect the way insurance companies are \\npermitted to illustrate certain IUL products.  We are required to comply with the amended guideline, AG49-B, for any IUL products \\nsold on, or after, May 1, 2023, and such compliance could impact our sales of such products.   The NAIC is also considering \\nmodiﬁcations to the economic scenario generator used to calculate life and annuity reserves according to the Valuation Manual (e.g., \\nVM-20 and VM-21) and the required capital for these life and annuity contracts, as well as certain ﬁxed annuity and single premium \\nlife insurance products, which could affect the level and volatility of statutory reserves and required capital for products in scope.  \\nThese modiﬁcations are expected to be implemented by January 1, 2025, at the earliest.  Effective December 31, 2022, the NAIC \\nrevised the C-2 mortality calculation that is expected to result in a small decrease in risk-based capital (“RBC”).  For more information, \\nsee “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation and in \\nsupervisory and enforcement policies may affect our insurance subsidiary capital requirements, reduce our proﬁtability, limit our \\ngrowth or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.”  We are monitoring all potential \\nchanges and evaluating the potential impact they could have on our product offerings, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nFor more information on statutory reserving and our use of captive reinsurance structures, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – \\nHolding Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital –Subsidiaries’ Capital” in the MD&A. \\n \\nInsurance Holding Company Regulation \\n \\nLNC and its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of \\nIndiana and New York.  These insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are \\nmembers of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities, to ﬁle with it certain \\nreports disclosing information, including their capital structure, ownership, management, ﬁnancial condition and certain inter-company \\ntransactions, including material transfers of assets and inter-company business agreements, and to report material changes in that \\ninformation.  These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain circumstances, prior \\napproval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an inter-company transaction.  Further, these laws require \\nthat an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder afﬁliates is reasonable in relation to \\nthe insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its ﬁnancial needs. \\n \\nIn general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital \\nstock unless such person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such \\nacquisition of control.  Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or \\nindirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company.  This \\npresumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.  The insurance commissioner, however, may ﬁnd that \\n“control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities.  To obtain approval from the \\ninsurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must ﬁle with the applicable \\ncommissioner an application containing information regarding: the identity and background of the acquirer and its afﬁliates; the nature, \\nsource and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the ﬁnancial statements of the acquirer and its afﬁliates; any \\npotential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be acquired; any contracts \\nwith respect to the securities to be acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.  \\n \\nOther jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for \\nprior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those \\njurisdictions.  Additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing \\nlicenses upon an acquisition of control.  In addition, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends \\nto us by our insurance subsidiaries.

The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus \\nappropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk proﬁle.  There are ﬁve major \\nrisks involved in determining the requirements:\\n \\n  \\n     \\nCategory  Name Description\\nAsset risk – afﬁliates  C-0Risk of declining value of insurance subsidiaries and risk from off-balance sheet \\n   and other miscellaneous accounts\\nAsset risk – others  C-1Risk of assets’ default of principal and interest or ﬂuctuation in fair value\\nInsurance risk  C-2Risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately \\npricing \\n   business to be written in the future\\nInterest rate risk, health \\ncredit C-3Risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk that health beneﬁts prepaid \\nto\\nrisk and market risk   providers become the obligation of the health insurer once again and risk of loss \\ndue \\n   to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guarantees\\nBusiness risk  C-4Risk of general business\\n \\nA company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, \\npremium, claim, expense and reserve items.  Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to \\nthe RBC determined by the formula.  Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total \\nadjusted capital, as deﬁned by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as deﬁned by the NAIC.  \\n \\nAccordingly, factors that have an impact on the total adjusted capital of our insurance subsidiaries, such as the permitted practices \\ndiscussed above or changes in actuarial assumptions that cause us to increase our reserves, will also affect their RBC levels.  Four \\nlevels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is insufﬁcient: \\n \\n\\x00“Company action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing \\ncorrective action it proposes to undertake;  \\n\\x00“Regulatory action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer must submit a plan, but a regulator may \\nalso issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a speciﬁed period; \\n\\x00“Authorized control level” – If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the regulatory response is the same as at the \\n“Regulatory action level,” but, in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer; and \\n\\x00“Mandatory control level” – If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer. \\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their respective states of domicile and the NAIC all \\nexceeded the “company action level.”  We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in \\nexcess of “company action level” through prudent underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital management.  However, no \\nassurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our control, will not \\ncause the RBC ratios to fall below the “company action level” or below our targeted levels, which are signiﬁcantly higher than the \\n“company action level.” These developments may include, but may not be limited to:  changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is \\ncalculated; new regulatory requirements for calculating reserves, such as principles-based reserving; economic conditions leading to \\nhigher levels of impairments of securities in our insurance subsidiaries’ general accounts; and an inability to ﬁnance life reserves such \\nas through the issuance of letters of credit (“LOCs”) supporting inter-company reinsurance structures. \\n \\nSee “Item 1A.

These laws require, among other things, \\nthat we institute certain policies and procedures in our business to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure, disclose \\nour collection practices to consumers and customers, and promptly notify and report certain types of incidents involving this data.  The \\nlaws and regulations vary by jurisdiction, and it is expected that additional laws and regulations will continue to be enacted.   While we \\nemploy robust and tested privacy and information security programs, as regulators establish further regulations for addressing consumer \\nand customer privacy, we may need to amend our policies and adapt our internal procedures.  See “Item 1A.

The marketplace continues to evolve in the changing regulatory environment.   \\n \\nFinancial Reform Legislation\\n \\nSince it was enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) has imposed \\nconsiderable reform in the ﬁnancial services industry.  The ongoing implementation continues to present challenges and uncertainties \\nfor ﬁnancial market participants.  For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act and corresponding global initiatives imposed signiﬁcant changes to \\nthe regulation of derivatives transactions, which we use to mitigate many types of risk in our business.  As we post and collect initial \\nmargin in compliance with requirements that began in September 2021, we continue to evaluate the ways we are required to manage \\nour derivatives trading and the attendant liquidity requirements.  For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, \\nRegulatory and Tax – Implementation of the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation relating to the regulation of \\nderivatives transactions subject us to margin requirements, the impact of which remains uncertain.”\\n \\nOur trading activities are also affected by the scheduled phaseout of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (the publication of \\nwhich is scheduled to cease by June 2023) and the use of alternative reference rates and related adjustments.  We continue to prepare \\nfor and monitor developments regarding these changes in order to reduce potential disruptions.  As ﬁnancial services regulatory reform \\ncontinues to evolve in the U.S. and abroad, and the marketplace continues to respond, the extent to which our derivatives costs and \\nstrategies may change and the extent to which those changes may affect the range or pricing of our products remains uncertain.\\n \\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to study the implications resulting from the \\ndifferent standards applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers and empowered the SEC to adopt a uniform ﬁduciary standard.  \\nIn January 2011, the SEC released its study on the obligations and standards of conduct of ﬁnancial professionals.  The SEC staff \\ninitially recommended establishing a uniform ﬁduciary standard for investment advisers and broker-dealers when providing investment \\nadvice about securities, including guidance for principal trading and deﬁnitions of the duties of loyalty and care owed to retail \\ncustomers that would be consistent with the standard that currently applies to investment advisers.  Then, in June 2019, pursuant to the \\nauthority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted “Regulation Best Interest,” which established a higher standard of care and \\ndisclosure for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, but did not create an explicit ﬁduciary duty.  For more \\ninformation, see “SEC Rules and Other Regulations relating to the Standard of Care Applicable to Investment Advisers and Broker-\\nDealers” below.\\n \\nAdditional provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include, among other things, the creation of a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \\nto protect consumers of certain ﬁnancial products; and changes to certain corporate governance rules.  The Federal Insurance Ofﬁce \\nestablished under the Dodd-Frank Act issues annually a wide-ranging report on the state of insurance regulation in the U.S., together \\nwith a series of recommendations on ways to monitor and improve the regulatory environment.  The ultimate impact of these \\nrecommendations on our business is undeterminable at this time.\\n \\nSEC Rules and Other Regulations relating to the Standard of Care Applicable to Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers \\n \\nIn 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) released the DOL Fiduciary Rule, which became effective in 2017 and substantially \\nexpanded the range of activities considered to be ﬁduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \\n1974 (“ERISA”) and the Internal Revenue Code.  The DOL Fiduciary Rule was subsequently vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe Fifth Circuit (the “Fifth Circuit”) in March 2018, and in June 2018, the Fifth Circuit issued a mandate stating that the original \\ndeﬁnition of “ﬁduciary,” including the original ﬁve-part test, would apply going forward.\\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 27/324 \\n1430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 28/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nIn 2019, the SEC approved “Regulation Best Interest,” including a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers under the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), which requires broker-dealers and their representatives to act in the best interest \\nof retail customers when making recommendations of any securities transaction, without putting their ﬁnancial interests ahead of the \\ninterests of retail customers.  The ﬁnal rule includes guidance on what constitutes a “recommendation” and a deﬁnition of who would \\nbe a “retail customer” in addition to provisions setting forth certain required disclosures, policies and procedures to identify conﬂicts of \\ninterest, and customer-speciﬁc best interest obligations.\\n \\nIn addition, the SEC approved the use of a new disclosure document, the customer or client relationship summary, or Form CRS.  Form \\nCRS is intended to provide retail investors with information about the nature of their relationship with their investment professional and \\nsupplements other more detailed disclosures, including existing Form ADV for advisers and the new disclosures under Regulation Best \\nInterest for broker-dealers.  Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS became effective as of September\\xa010, 2019, with a transition period \\nfor compliance through June\\xa030, 2020, as of which date broker-dealers were required to be compliant.\\n \\nFinally, the SEC issued interpretative guidance regarding an investment adviser’s ﬁduciary obligation under the Advisers Act.  The \\nguidance indicates that investment advisers have a ﬁduciary duty to their clients that includes both a duty of care and a duty of loyalty \\nand further describes an investment adviser’s responsibilities under these ﬁduciary duties.  \\n \\nIn June 2020, the DOL proposed a new prohibited transaction exemption, which was ﬁnalized in December 2020.  The new exemption \\nwent into effect on February 16, 2021, and had a transition period for compliance that extended into 2022.  The new exemption allows \\nthe payment of compensation to investment advice ﬁduciaries who comply with the exemption’s requirements and generally tracks the \\nstandard set forth in Regulation Best Interest.  Lawsuits challenging certain aspects of the rule and related guidance have been initiated, \\nand there may be additional efforts to challenge or revise this rule in the future.  In addition, the DOL has indicated in its regulatory \\nagenda that it plans to issue updated proposed rulemaking related to ﬁduciary advice.  It is uncertain at this point whether these changes \\nwould have a material impact on our business.\\n \\nIn addition to the SEC and DOL rules, the NAIC and several states, including Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, have \\neither enacted or proposed laws and regulations requiring investment advisers, broker-dealers and/or agents to meet a higher standard of \\ncare and provide additional disclosures when providing advice to their clients.  The recently enacted state laws and regulations have \\nresulted in, and upon adoption by other states such laws and regulations may result in, additional requirements related to the sale of our \\nproducts.  Additional disclosure and other requirements could adversely affect our business by causing us to reevaluate or change \\ncertain business practices or otherwise.  \\n \\nIf any revised DOL ﬁduciary rule or any additional new rules that are implemented are more onerous than Regulation Best Interest, or \\nare not coordinated with Regulation Best Interest, the impact on our business could be substantial.  While we continue to monitor and \\nevaluate the various proposals, we cannot predict what other proposals may be made, or what new legislation or regulation may be \\nintroduced or become law.  Therefore, until such time as ﬁnal rules or laws are in place, the potential impact on our business is \\nuncertain.\\n \\nFederal Tax Legislation \\n \\nIn late 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law.  The Tax Act resulted in signiﬁcant reforms for \\ncorporations (in addition to individuals), including a number of provisions that directly impacted insurance companies.  The vast \\nmajority of the changes became effective January\\xa01, 2018.  Throughout 2022, the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury ﬁnalized \\npublished guidance on the various provisions of the Tax Act.  The issuance of this and prior guidance has not changed our interpretation \\nand related implementation of the law changes in the Tax Act.\\n \\nIn August 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden.  The \\nInﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 established a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations whose average adjusted net \\nincome for any consecutive three-year period beginning after December 31, 2022, exceeds $1.0 billion.  The Inﬂation Reduction Act of \\n2022 also established a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded corporations.  Both provisions are effective for tax \\nyears beginning after December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax on our \\nbusiness, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nWe will continue to be actively engaged with policymakers including the Biden Administration to ensure the impacts of tax policy \\nchanges on our business and our customers are well understood.\\n \\nOutside of potential tax law changes, the uncertainty of federal funding and the future of the Social Security Disability Insurance \\n(“SSDI”) program can have a substantial impact on the entire group beneﬁt market because SSDI beneﬁts are a direct offset to the \\nbeneﬁts paid under group disability policies.  Congress alleviated some of this uncertainty by passing the Bipartisan Budget Act of \\n2015.  As a result, the Social Security Administration’s 2022 Annual Report projects that the SSDI reserves will not be depleted until \\n2035.\\n \\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 29/3241530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 30/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\\n \\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was subsequently amended by \\nthe Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.  This legislation, as well as subsequent state and federal laws and regulations, \\nincludes provisions that provide for additional taxes to help ﬁnance the cost of these reforms and substantive changes and additions to \\nhealth care and related laws, which could potentially impact some of our lines of business.  We continue to monitor any efforts by the \\ngovernment to repeal or replace provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the effect those efforts may have on \\nour businesses. \\n \\nPatriot Act\\n \\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes anti-money laundering and ﬁnancial transparency laws as well as various regulations \\napplicable to broker-dealers and other ﬁnancial services companies, including insurance companies.  Financial institutions are required \\nto collect information regarding the identity of their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for \\ninformation by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other ﬁnancial institutions.  As a result, \\nwe are required to maintain certain internal compliance practices, procedures and controls.\\n \\nSECURE Act\\n \\nIn December 2019, President Trump signed into law the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (the “SECURE \\nAct”).  Most of the provisions of the SECURE Act were effective for plan years beginning after December\\xa031, 2019.  Among other \\nthings, the provisions of the SECURE Act make it easier for employers to offer lifetime income options in deﬁned contribution \\nretirement plans, facilitate the ability of small employers to offer access to retirement savings vehicles to their employees and increase \\nopportunities for workers to save by enhancing retirement plan automatic enrollment and escalation features.  Congress continued to \\nbuild on the value created by the SECURE Act by passing SECURE Act 2.0 on December 29, 2022.  This legislation also helps \\nincrease plan adoption and savings opportunities, while also making the offering of lifetime income in plans more feasible.  We believe \\nthat the ﬁnancial services industry will continue to beneﬁt from the adoption of these legislative changes through continued or increased \\nsavings in retirement and annuity solutions, including through the utilization of Lincoln’s suite of offerings.\\n \\nERISA Considerations\\n \\nERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee beneﬁt plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions.  \\nPlans subject to ERISA include pension and proﬁt-sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans.  ERISA \\nprovisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan ﬁduciaries and prohibitions on transactions \\nknown as “prohibited transactions,” such as conﬂict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a beneﬁt plan and a party \\nin interest.  ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement.  Our insurance, asset management, plan \\nadministrative services and other businesses provide services to employee beneﬁt plans subject to ERISA, including services where we \\nmay act as an ERISA ﬁduciary.  In addition, because certain of our businesses provide products and services to ERISA plans, \\ntransactions with those plans are subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules, which may affect our ability to enter into transactions, \\nor the terms on which transactions may be entered into, with such plans, even if the business entering into the transaction is unrelated to \\nthe business giving rise to party-in-interest status. \\n \\nBroker-Dealer and Securities Regulation\\n \\nIn addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor \\nare registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain of these entities are \\nqualiﬁed for sale in some or all states and the District of Columbia.  We also have subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers \\nunder the Exchange Act and are subject to federal and state regulation, including, but not limited to, the Financial Industry Regulation \\nAuthority’s (“FINRA”) net capital rules.  In addition, we have subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers under the Investment \\nAdvisers Act of 1940.  Agents, advisers and employees registered or associated with any of our investment adviser or broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries are subject to federal securities laws and to examination requirements and regulation by state and federal securities \\nregulators.  Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those individuals.  The SEC and other governmental \\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative \\nproceedings that can result in censure, ﬁnes, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension and termination or limitation of the \\nactivities of the regulated entity or its employees.  For more information about regulatory and litigation matters, see Note 13.\\n \\nEnvironmental Considerations \\n \\nFederal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property.  Inherent in owning \\nand operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up.  Under the laws of \\ncertain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which \\ncould adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending.  In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 31/324against such property.  In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \\nLiability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened \\nreleases of \\n \\n \\n1630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 32/324Table of Contents\\n \\nhazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us.  We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged \\nto us.  Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged \\nreal estate, provided that certain requirements are met.  However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to \\nCERCLA liability.  Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on \\nus for costs associated with environmental hazards. \\n \\nWe routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to \\nreal property collateralizing mortgages that we hold.  Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, based on these \\nenvironmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with \\nenvironmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \\n \\nIn addition, certain of our regulators have proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, environmental, social and governance \\n(“ESG”) rules or standards that would apply to our business.  For example, in March 2022, the SEC proposed extensive rule changes \\nthat would require companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports ﬁled \\nwith the SEC.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from \\ninvestors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise \\nadversely impact our business and results of operations” and “– Climate change and climate change regulation may adversely affect our \\ninvestment portfolio and ﬁnancial condition.” \\n \\nIntellectual Property\\n \\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.  We \\nhave implemented a patent strategy designed to protect innovative aspects of our products and processes which we believe distinguish \\nus from competitors.  We currently own several issued U.S. patents.\\n \\nWe have an extensive portfolio of trademarks and service marks that we consider important in the marketing of our products and \\nservices, including, among others, the trademarks of the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial names, the Lincoln silhouette logo and \\nthe combination of these marks.  Trademark registrations may be renewed indeﬁnitely subject to continued use and registration \\nrequirements.  We regard our trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and services and intend to protect them against \\ninfringement and dilution.\\n \\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had a total of 11,316 employees, all based in the United States.  Our mission is to help Americans \\nachieve ﬁnancial peace of mind by offering leading products and services.  We believe that every move we make, including how we \\nmanage talent, shapes the future we share with our customers, communities and investors.  Accordingly, each of our employees has \\naccess to important resources designed to, among other things, help them improve their well-being, understand the value of their work, \\ndevelop their careers and thrive in a diverse and inclusive environment.  From the moment our employees become part of Lincoln, \\nthey’re empowered to “Be Lincoln” by living and acting with integrity and optimism in their communities, relationships and daily \\ninteractions with colleagues and clients.  Our enterprise strategy is driven by continued focus on this unique employee culture, \\nincluding the following key areas: \\n \\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\n \\nWe believe that diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to our ability to deliver on our promise to help customers secure their \\nﬁnancial futures.  Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is designed to deliver outcomes based on objectives and milestones in our \\nworkplace, marketplace and the broader communities we serve.  This strategy ensures that a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion \\npermeates every level of our organization as well as our interactions with partners and suppliers.\\n \\nOur Board of Directors provides executive oversight of stated priorities, progress and strategic plans to support diversity, equity and \\ninclusion across the enterprise.  Lincoln’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion begins at the highest level of management as a \\nformal expectation of our leaders and all employees, as part of our performance management process.  In 2022, we launched an annual \\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion conference available to all employees, featuring internal and external speakers and educational sessions.  \\nOur employees are actively involved in our efforts to further diversity, equity and inclusion at the company and beyond, through the \\nwork of our seven Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”).  We maintain our BRG chapters nationwide across seven categories:  African \\nAmerican, Asian American, Latino, LGBTQ+, People with Disabilities, Veterans and Women.  Each BRG is sponsored and supported \\nby senior leaders across the enterprise.\\n \\nEmployee Feedback and Employee Engagement \\n \\nWe actively listen to our employees in a variety of ways, including enterprise-wide and department-speciﬁc engagement surveys and \\nfocus groups, and we gather feedback on an ongoing basis.  The Company conducts a comprehensive, company-wide engagement \\nsurvey every two years, and often conducts department-speciﬁc pulse surveys in the alternate years, to inform our human resources \\nstrategy, measure progress and adjust plans, as necessary.  We focus on equipping our managers to foster employee development and \\nstrengthen their 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 33/324 \\n \\n1730/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 34/324Table of Contents\\n \\nvoices.  We support our managers through tools, resources and development programs to help them be the best leaders possible.  We \\nhave also created tools to help managers develop and execute on targeted action plans to address areas of opportunity for their work \\ngroups.\\n \\nTalent and Development\\n \\nOur talent strategy supports Lincoln’s ability to identify, develop, engage, retain and reward the talent we need for success in a \\ncompetitive environment of constant change.  Our employees work together with their managers to learn new skills, create an annual \\nindividual development plan and shape their careers.  Their collaborative efforts are backed by a variety of resources we make available \\nand guided by our Career Framework, which provides tools and resources to help employees discover, assess, plan and invest in their \\ncareers.  In 2022, we launched Get CAREER FIT, an enterprise-wide program to support all employees in creating a speciﬁc and \\ntargeted development plan.  This boot-camp style program includes expert advice, exercises and tools to clarify career aspirations and \\ndeﬁne speciﬁc steps to achieve success.  As part of the program, managers attend virtual instructor-led training to support their \\neffectiveness in having development conversations with their direct reports.\\n \\nOur vision is to foster a premier learning culture, one that enhances leadership effectiveness, accelerates employee development and \\nhelps drive business performance.  Employees can access a range of learning and development opportunities including numerous \\ninstructor-led, self-paced and curated courses.  We have partnered with Harvard Business Publishing, a subsidiary of Harvard Business \\nSchool, to offer courses speciﬁcally designed for our mid-level employees and senior level leaders.  All Lincoln employees can also \\naccess open online courses offered through third-party providers, including TED@Work and Harvard Business Publishing.  In 2022, we \\nlaunched a new Learner Experience Platform that serves as the front door to all of our learning content, courses and programs.\\n \\nTotal Rewards and Employee Well-Being\\n \\nWe invest in our employees’ futures by offering market-competitive compensation and a broad range of health and wellness programs \\nas well as retirement savings, ﬁnancial health and protection plans.  Our employees receive a personalized Your Total Rewards \\nstatement that provides a comprehensive look at their direct and indirect compensation - the total investment that we make in them. \\n \\nWe offer paid time off and various ﬂexible work arrangements, as part of a new hybrid work model that was informed by direct \\nfeedback from our workforce.  In addition, we offer beneﬁts and wellness programs focusing on the physical, emotional, social and \\nﬁnancial well-being of our employees.  For eligible employees, such programs include: \\n \\n\\x00a subsidized medical plan with domestic partner eligibility, plus optional dental and vision, a health savings account with a \\ncompany contribution and a healthcare ﬂexible spending account;\\n\\x00a well-being program that provides access to personal health coaches, health screenings and ﬂu shots, discounts and \\nreimbursements for programs that promote health;\\n\\x00an employee assistance program (“EAP”) that provides counseling and tools to manage well-being;\\n\\x00paid parental leave and adoption assistance programs;\\n\\x00fertility, pregnancy and parenting support;\\n\\x00a dependent care ﬂexible spending account;\\n\\x00access to Homework Connection which, provides one-on-one, on-demand homework help to students at no cost to employees; \\n\\x00dedicated Lincoln Financial Retirement Consultants to evaluate employee retirement readiness and help them map out ways to \\nimprove their readiness; in addition to an independent ﬁnancial wellness advisor for complete ﬁnancial well-being assistance;\\n\\x00our employee 401(k) plan with a company match and other convenient features; and\\n\\x00accident and critical illness insurance coverages, short- and long-term disability plans and company-provided life insurance.\\n \\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\\n \\nWe ﬁle annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act.  The SEC \\nmaintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including LNC, \\nthat ﬁle electronically with the SEC.

Risk Factors\\n \\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities.  The risks and uncertainties described below \\nare not the only ones facing our Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem \\nimmaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of these risks actually occur, our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of \\noperations could be materially affected.  In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.\\n \\nMarket Conditions\\n \\nWeak conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of \\noperations.\\n \\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. \\nand elsewhere around the world.  Major central bank policy actions, inﬂation, recessionary conditions and political policy uncertainty \\nremain key challenges for markets and our business.  These macro-economic conditions have in the past and may in the future have an \\nadverse effect on us given our credit and equity market exposure.  In the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global \\ncredit crisis and recession that occurred during 2008 and 2009, we could incur signiﬁcant losses.  Even in the absence of a market \\ndownturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss and ratings downgrades due to market volatility.\\n \\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, domestic and foreign government spending, the volatility and strength of the \\ncapital markets, the potential for inﬂation or deﬂation and uncertainty over domestic and foreign government actions all affect the \\nbusiness and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and proﬁtability of our business.  In an economic downturn \\ncharacterized by inﬂation, recessionary conditions, higher unemployment, lower disposable income, lower corporate earnings, lower \\nbusiness investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our ﬁnancial and insurance products could be adversely affected.  In \\naddition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience an elevated incidence of claims, and we could experience changes \\nin the rate of lapses or surrenders of policies or other changes in consumer behavior as a result of ﬁnancial stress.  Our contract holders \\nmay choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether.  Adverse changes in the economy have \\nin the past and could in the future affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of \\noperations and ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nChanges in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our proﬁtability, and \\nmake it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements.\\n \\nInterest rate ﬂuctuations and/or a sustained period of low interest rates could negatively affect our proﬁtability.  Some of our products, \\nprincipally ﬁxed annuities and UL, including linked-beneﬁt UL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in \\ninterest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the \\namounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts.  Spreads are an \\nimportant component of our net income.  Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are \\nnot enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of \\noperations.  In addition, low rates increase the cost of providing variable annuity living beneﬁt guarantees, which could negatively \\naffect our variable annuity proﬁtability. \\n \\nIn periods when interest rates are declining or remain at low levels, we may have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of \\nprincipal on our investments in lower yielding instruments reducing our spread.  Moreover, borrowers may prepay ﬁxed-income \\nsecurities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, \\nwhich exacerbates this risk.  Lowering interest crediting rates helps to mitigate the effect of spread compression on some of our \\nproducts.  However, because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our ﬁxed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established \\nintervals, and since many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could still decrease.  For \\nadditional information on our guaranteed crediting rates, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – \\nInterest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates.”\\n \\nGenerally, a decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy \\nobligations.  During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our recorded policy liabilities may not be sufﬁcient to meet future policy \\nobligations and may need to be strengthened, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period.  Accordingly, declining \\ninterest rates or sustained low-interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and cash ﬂows and \\nsigniﬁcantly reduce our proﬁtability.  In addition, a decline in or sustained period of low market interest rates may make it more \\nchallenging for us to pass certain asset adequacy tests related to statutory reserves, given the required conservatism of some of the \\nregulations with which we must comply.  To meet these requirements, we may be required to post asset adequacy reserves, which, \\ndepending on the size of the reserve, could materially affect our ﬁnancial results.\\n \\n \\n \\n1930/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 36/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect our proﬁtability, capital position and the value of our investment portfolio and may \\nalso result in increased contract withdrawals.\\n \\nThroughout 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate target range to combat inﬂation.  In February 2023, the Federal \\nReserve announced an additional 25 basis points increase, when it set the range at 4.50% to 4.75% and reiterated its commitment to \\nimplement and maintain policy as needed to bring inﬂation down.  In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, such as that we are \\nexperiencing currently, while higher interest rates will lead to higher yields on our asset portfolios, such increases in yield may be more \\nthan offset by increases in crediting rates necessary to keep our interest-sensitive products competitive and potentially higher borrowing \\ncosts, thus lowering our spreads.  In such a scenario, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower proﬁtability or face a decline \\nin sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. \\n \\nAn increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio and capital \\nposition, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the ﬁxed-income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our \\ninvestment portfolio.  This decline in the fair value of ﬁxed-income securities can have an adverse impact on our capital position, \\nparticularly from a  GAAP perspective, as the decline in fair value of ﬁxed-income securities may not be offset by a corresponding \\ndecline in the value of liabilities due to higher interest rates.  An increase in interest rates could also result in decreased fee income \\nassociated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account values invested in ﬁxed-income funds.  In addition, statutory capital \\nrequirements for certain ﬁxed annuity and single premium life insurance products incorporate stochastic projections that can result in \\nincreased capital requirements, particularly as interest rates increase, which may affect our reported RBC ratio. \\n \\nIncreases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products.  In periods of increasing interest rates, \\npolicy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as contract holders seek to \\nbuy products with perceived higher returns.  This process may lead to a ﬂow of cash out of our businesses.  These outﬂows may require \\ninvestments to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may \\nresult in realized investment losses that reduce our capital position.  A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or \\nwithdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds.  Furthermore, unanticipated increases in withdrawals \\nand terminations may accelerate amortization of our deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”) \\nassets, which would reduce net income.  \\n \\nBecause the equity markets impact the proﬁtability and expected proﬁtability of many of our products, changes in equity markets may \\nsigniﬁcantly affect our business and proﬁtability.\\n \\nThe fee income that we earn on certain products, including variable annuities, is based primarily upon account values, and the fee \\nincome that we earn on VUL policies is partially based upon account values.  Because strong equity markets result in higher account \\nvalues, strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee income.  Conversely, a weakening of the equity \\nmarkets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources.\\n \\nChanges in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the proﬁtability of our products with guaranteed beneﬁts; therefore, \\nsuch changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and proﬁtability.\\n \\nCertain of our variable annuity and ﬁxed indexed annuity products include optional guaranteed beneﬁt riders, including GDB (variable \\nannuity only) and GLB riders.  The fair value of these guaranteed beneﬁt riders is impacted by changes in equity markets, interest rates, \\nvolatility, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads.  Accordingly, strong equity markets, increases in interest rates and decreases in \\nvolatility will generally decrease the guaranteed beneﬁt riders liability and would result in an increase to our earnings.  Conversely, a \\ndecrease in the equity markets along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase to \\nthe guaranteed beneﬁt riders liability and would result in a decrease to our earnings.  \\n \\nCertain of our VUL products include secondary guarantees.  We accrue additional liabilities for these secondary guarantees, and these \\nliabilities are impacted by changes in equity markets.  Accordingly, strong equity markets generally decrease these additional liabilities.  \\nConversely, a decrease in the equity markets will generally increase these additional liabilities.  We use a hedge to partially mitigate the \\nrisk related to equity market volatility and are evaluating other ﬁnancing solutions, but there can be no guarantee that our hedge or other \\nsolutions will be fully effective to mitigate this risk.  \\n \\nOur hedging strategies may not be fully effective to offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees on certain of our \\nproducts, which could result in volatility in our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition under GAAP and in the capital levels of \\nour insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.\\n \\nWe use a variety of hedging strategies to mitigate the risks to the capital of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries associated with \\ncertain guarantees on our variable products.  However, the hedging strategies may not be fully effective to offset the changes in the \\ncarrying value of these guarantees, as our hedging strategies hedge risks on a basis that does not correspond to their anticipated or \\nactual impact upon our results of operations or ﬁnancial condition under GAAP.  Changes from period to period in the valuation of \\nthese guarantees, and in the amount of our obligations effectively hedged, will result in volatility in our results of operations and \\nﬁnancial condition under GAAP and in the capital levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.

The insurance \\ndepartments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries.  The extent of regulation \\nby the states varies, but, in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves, \\nreinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving policy forms, \\nregulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of statutory ﬁnancial statements and reports, \\nregulating the type and amount of investments permitted, and standards of business conduct.  In addition, state insurance holding \\ncompany laws impose restrictions on certain inter-company transactions and limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance \\nsubsidiaries can pay.\\n \\nState insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their \\nproducts.  Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, sometimes lead to changes in business practices or \\nadditional expense, statutory reserves and/or RBC requirements for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our \\nﬁnancial condition and results of operations.  For example, the NAIC is considering modiﬁcations to the economic scenario generator \\nused to calculate life and annuity reserves according to the Valuation Manual (e.g. VM-20 and VM-21) and the required capital for \\nthese life and annuity contracts, as well as certain ﬁxed annuity and single premium life insurance products, which could affect the level \\nand volatility of statutory reserves and required capital for products in scope.  The economic scenarios are a key input in the statutory \\nreserve and required capital calculations for certain products, such as variable annuities.  If the NAIC adopts an economic scenario \\ngenerator that produces scenarios with characteristics that differ signiﬁcantly from what the current economic scenario generator \\nprescribed in these calculations would produce under the same circumstances, this could have a signiﬁcant impact on the statutory \\nreserves and required capital for products in scope upon adoption as well as affect how the statutory reserves and required capital for \\nthese products respond to changes in market conditions.   We are monitoring all potential changes and evaluating the potential impact \\nthey could have on our product offerings and ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.  See “Item 1. Business – Regulatory – \\nInsurance Regulation” for a discussion of additional changes under consideration and recent changes implemented by the NAIC, \\nincluding changes to principles-based reserving and changes to actuarial guidelines, and the impact of such changes on our business. \\n \\nAlthough we endeavor to maintain all required licenses and approvals, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of \\napplicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to \\ntime.  Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals.  If we do not have \\nthe requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities \\ncould preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial ﬁnes.  Further, insurance \\nregulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the \\nbusiness and operations of an insurance company.  As of December 31, 2022, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us \\nany material ﬁnes or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of \\nsupervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or ﬁnancial \\ncondition.\\n \\nCompliance with existing and emerging privacy regulations could result in increased compliance costs and/or lead to changes in \\nbusiness practices and policies, and any failure to protect the conﬁdentiality of personal information could adversely affect our \\nreputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nComplying with the numerous privacy laws and regulations to which we are subject and other existing, emerging and changing privacy \\nrequirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and policies.  Non-compliance \\ncould result in monetary penalties or signiﬁcant legal liability.  For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Privacy \\nRegulations.”\\n \\nMany of the employees and associates who conduct our business have access to, and routinely process, personal information through a \\nvariety of media, including information technology systems.  We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the \\nconﬁdentiality of personal information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our employees and our associates, including service \\nproviders, distribution partners, independent agents and others.  It is possible that an employee or associate could, intentionally or \\nunintentionally, disclose or misappropriate conﬁdential consumer or client information or our data could be the subject of a \\ncybersecurity attack.  State and federal laws and regulations also require us to disclose our data collection and sharing practices to our \\nconsumers and customers and to provide certain consumers and customers with access to certain pieces of their personal information, \\nthe right to request correction of their information, the right to request deletion of their information, and the right to opt out of certain \\ntracking, sharing and processing.  We rely on various internal processes and associates to report our practices accurately and to respond \\nappropriately to consumer and customer requests.  We cannot predict what, if any, actions from U.S. state and federal regulators may be \\ntaken if we fail to maintain these processes or if we or our associates fail to comply with our policies or procedures.  If we or our \\nassociates fail to comply with applicable processes, policies, procedures and controls, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional \\ninappropriate disclosure or misuse of consumer or client information, or violation of applicable state or federal laws, could occur.

There has been increased scrutiny, including from U.S. state and \\nfederal regulators, regarding the use of “big data” techniques such as price optimization.  In August 2020, members of the NAIC \\nunanimously adopted guiding principles on artiﬁcial intelligence, to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, \\nprofessionals and stakeholders across the insurance industry as they implement artiﬁcial intelligence tools to facilitate operations.  We \\ncannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to “big data,” but any inquiries and limitations could have a material \\nimpact on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters may \\nadversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations. \\n \\nCertain existing or potential investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders evaluate our business or other practices according \\nto a variety of ESG standards and expectations.  Certain of our regulators have proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, ESG \\nrules or standards that would apply to our business.  For example, in March 2022, the SEC proposed extensive rule changes that would \\nrequire companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports ﬁled with the SEC.  \\nESG-related rules, guidance and policies may impose additional costs, cause changes to our corporate governance and risk management \\npractices and expose the industry to new or additional risks.\\n \\nOur practices may be judged by ESG standards that are continually evolving and not always clear.  Prevailing ESG standards and \\nexpectations may also reﬂect contrasting or conﬂicting values or agendas.  We may fail to meet our ESG-related commitments or \\ntargets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG standards in coordination with other business priorities may not \\nprove completely effective or satisfy investors, customers, regulators or others.  We may face adverse regulatory, investor, customer, \\nmedia or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational or legal challenges, which could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise \\nadversely affect our business and results of operations, including but not limited to the ability to sell products, policyholder retention \\nand increased cost of ﬁnancing.\\n \\nFederal or state regulatory actions could result in substantial ﬁnes, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities \\nand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nOur broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject \\nto regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or state securities regulators.  Applicable laws and regulations generally grant \\nsupervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the \\nsubsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations.  The foregoing \\nregulatory or governmental bodies, as well as the DOL and others, have the authority to review our products and business practices and \\nthose of our agents, advisers, registered representatives, associated persons and employees.  In recent years, there has been increased \\nscrutiny by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of \\ndisclosure documents.  These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, \\nour practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper.  These actions can result in substantial ﬁnes, penalties or prohibitions \\nor restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial \\ncondition.\\n \\nChanges to laws or regulations could adversely affect our distribution model and may result in additional disclosure and other \\nrequirements related to the sale and delivery of our products and services, which may adversely affect our business.\\n \\nIn 2019, the SEC approved “Regulation Best Interest,” including a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, \\nwhich requires broker-dealers and their representatives to act in the best interest of retail customers when making recommendations of \\nany securities transaction, without putting their ﬁnancial interests ahead of the interests of retail customers.  Among other things, the \\nﬁnal rule includes provisions setting forth certain required disclosures, policies and procedures to identify conﬂicts of interest, and \\ncustomer-speciﬁc best interest obligations.  In addition, the SEC approved the use of a new disclosure document, Form CRS, which is \\nintended to provide retail investors with information about the nature of their relationship with their investment professional and \\nsupplements other more detailed disclosures.  Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS became effective as of September 10, 2019, with \\na transition period for compliance through June 30, 2020, as of which date broker-dealers were required to be compliant.  \\n \\nIn June 2020, the DOL proposed a new prohibited transaction exemption, which was ﬁnalized in December 2020.  The new exemption \\nwent into effect on February 16, 2021, and had a transition period for compliance that extended into 2022.  The new exemption allows \\nthe payment of compensation to investment advice ﬁduciaries who comply with the exemption’s requirements and generally tracks the \\nstandard set forth in Regulation Best Interest.  Lawsuits challenging certain aspects of the rule and related guidance have been initiated, \\nand there may be additional efforts to challenge or revise this rule in the future.  In addition, the DOL has indicated in its regulatory \\nagenda that it plans to issue proposed rulemaking related to ﬁduciary advice.  It is uncertain at this point whether these changes would \\nhave a material impact on our business.\\n \\nIn addition to the SEC and DOL rules, the NAIC and several states have either enacted or proposed laws and regulations requiring \\ninvestment advisers, broker-dealers and/or agents to meet a higher standard of care and provide additional disclosures when providing \\nadvice to their clients, resulting in additional requirements related to the sale of our products.

Business – Regulatory – Federal Initiatives – SEC Rules and Other Regulations relating to the Standard of Care Applicable \\nto Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers.”\\n \\nAdditional disclosure and other requirements could adversely affect our business by causing us to reevaluate or change certain business \\npractices or otherwise.  If any revised DOL ﬁduciary rule or any additional new rules that are implemented are more onerous than \\nRegulation Best Interest, or are not coordinated with Regulation Best Interest, the impact on our business could be substantial.  While \\nwe continue to monitor and evaluate the various proposals, we cannot predict what other proposals may be made, or what new \\nlegislation or regulation may be introduced or become law.  Therefore, until such time as ﬁnal rules or laws are in place, the potential \\nimpact on our business is uncertain.\\n \\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could impact our tax costs and the products that we sell.\\n \\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes and negatively impact our results of operations \\nand ﬁnancial condition.  Tax authorities may enact changes in tax law or issue new regulations or other pronouncements that could \\nincrease our current tax burden and impose new taxes on our business.  Guidance on previously enacted tax law changes could impact \\nour interpretations of existing law and also have an impact on our business. \\n \\nIn August 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden.  The \\nInﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 established a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations whose average adjusted net \\nincome for any consecutive three-year period beginning after December 31, 2022, exceeds $1.0 billion.  This provision is effective for \\ntax years beginning after December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the impact of this new alternative minimum \\ntax on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nLegal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in ﬁnancial losses or harm our businesses.\\n \\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our business.  Pending legal and \\nregulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are speciﬁc to us and proceedings that \\nare typical of the businesses in which we operate.  Some of these legal proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged \\nclasses of complainants.  In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or \\nexemplary damages.  Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material ﬁnancial effect or \\ncause signiﬁcant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm our business prospects.  See Note 13 for a description of \\nlegal and regulatory proceedings and actions.  \\n \\nClimate change and climate change regulation may adversely affect our investment portfolio and ﬁnancial condition. \\n \\nClimate change and climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold or our \\nwillingness to continue to hold their securities.  Climate change could also impact our counterparties and other third parties, including, \\namong others, reinsurers and derivatives counterparties.  Additionally, the value of investments, including real estate investments we \\nhold, and the broader market indices could be adversely affected, which may impact our product proﬁtability and the ability to write \\nnew business.  Although we have performed, and will continue to perform, climate change scenario analyses with respect to the \\ninvestments in portions of our general account, we cannot accurately predict the long-term impacts on us or our portfolio from climate \\nchange or related regulation.\\n \\nImplementation of the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation relating to the regulation of derivatives \\ntransactions subjects us to margin requirements, the impact of which remains uncertain. \\n \\nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), and corresponding global initiatives, \\nincluding the European Market Infrastructure Regulation implemented in 2012, imposed signiﬁcant changes to the regulation of \\nderivatives transactions, which we use to mitigate many types of risk in our business.  The European Market Infrastructure Regulation \\nand matching U.K. rules impose initial margin requirements that largely correspond to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  As an \\nexception, our Europe-based swap providers may be subject to additional margin requirements with respect to equity options beginning \\nin 2024, which may require us to post and collect additional initial margin.  Until the application of initial margin requirements is \\ncomplete, the impact of these provisions on liquidity and capital resources remains uncertain.\\n \\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely \\naffect our ﬁnancial statements.\\n \\nOur ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP as identiﬁed in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) \\nAccounting Standards CodiﬁcationTM (“ASC”).  From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or \\nguidance that are incorporated into the FASB ASC.  It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could \\nchange the current accounting treatment that we apply to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and that such changes could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 43/3242330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 44/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nSpeciﬁcally, in August 2018, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for \\nLong-Duration Contracts.  We began accounting under the new method as of the January 1, 2023, effective date, which has resulted in \\nsigniﬁcant changes to how we account for and report our insurance contracts (both in-force and new business), including\\xa0updating \\nassumptions used to measure the liability for future policy beneﬁts for traditional and limited-payment contracts, measuring of market \\nrisk beneﬁts (“MRBs”) and changing the amortization of DAC and DAC-like intangibles.\\xa0 See Note 2 for more information regarding \\nour adoption of this standard.  See also “Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the proﬁtability of our \\nproducts with guaranteed beneﬁts; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and proﬁtability” above.\\n \\nOur domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to SAP.  Any changes in the method of calculating reserves for our life insurance and \\nannuity products under SAP may result in increased reserve requirements.\\n \\nThe NAIC also adopts changes to its regulations from time to time, which, depending on the scope of the change, could materially \\naffect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.  See “Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation.”\\n \\nAnti-takeover provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if the change in control would be beneﬁcial to LNC \\nshareholders.\\n \\nWe are an Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law.  Certain provisions of Indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover \\nbids or other change in control events affecting us.  Under Indiana law, directors may, in considering the best interests of a corporation, \\nconsider the effects of any action on shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which \\nofﬁces and other facilities are located, and other factors the directors consider pertinent.  One statutory provision prohibits, except \\nunder speciﬁed circumstances, LNC from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our \\ncommon stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an “interested shareholder”) for a period of ﬁve years \\nfollowing the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such business combination is approved by the Board \\nof Directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder.  \\n \\nIn addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control.  \\nAs an insurance holding company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company \\nacts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled.  The insurance holding company acts and regulations \\nrestrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval.  Under those statutes and \\nregulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company, or \\nan insurance holding company which controls an insurance company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such \\ntransaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company or insurance company.  “Control” is generally deﬁned as the \\ndirect or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person \\ndirectly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.  \\n \\nLiquidity and Capital Position\\n \\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\\n \\nIn the event that our current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional ﬁnancing.  The availability of \\nadditional ﬁnancing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of \\ntrading activities, the overall availability of credit to the ﬁnancial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the \\npossibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term ﬁnancial prospects if we incur large \\ninvestment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn.  Similarly, our access to funds may be \\nimpaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Ratings” \\nin the MD&A for a description of our credit ratings.  Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufﬁcient, and in such case, we \\nmay not be able to successfully obtain additional ﬁnancing on favorable terms, or at all.\\n \\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our \\nbusiness, most signiﬁcantly our insurance operations.  Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, \\nmaturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital requirements; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs; and \\naccess the capital necessary to grow our business.  As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than \\nwe prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our proﬁtability and signiﬁcantly reduce our ﬁnancial ﬂexibility.  \\nOur results of operations, ﬁnancial condition, cash ﬂows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by \\ndisruptions in the ﬁnancial markets.\\n \\nBecause we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufﬁcient \\namounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations.\\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions related to the transfer of funds and \\npayment of dividends to LNC, including statutory limitations on the amount of dividends that can be paid.  In addition, payments of \\ndividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 45/324respective jurisdictions requiring that our insurance subsidiaries hold a speciﬁed amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future \\nobligations on their \\n \\n \\n2430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 46/324Table of Contents\\n \\noutstanding policies.  In order to meet their claims-paying obligations, our insurance subsidiaries regularly monitor their reserves to \\nensure we hold sufﬁcient amounts to cover actual or expected contract and claims payments.  At times, we may determine that reserves \\nin excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure sufﬁciency.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Holding Company Sources and \\nUses of Liquidity and Capital – Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends” in the MD&A for additional information regarding these \\nrestrictions and requirements.\\n \\nChanges in, or reinterpretations of, these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds \\nto us in sufﬁcient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses.  Requiring our insurance \\nsubsidiaries to hold additional reserves has the potential to constrain their ability to pay dividends to the holding company.  \\n \\nThe earnings of our insurance subsidiaries impact contract holders’ surplus.  Lower earnings constrain the growth in our insurance \\nsubsidiaries’ capital, and therefore, can constrain the payment of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us.  In addition, the \\namount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus they hold to maintain \\ntheir ﬁnancial strength ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.  \\nAs a result, to the extent our subsidiaries are unable or are materially restricted from being able to pay dividends to us in sufﬁcient \\namounts, our ability to meet our obligations could be materially affected.\\n \\nA decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer ﬁnancial \\nstrength ratings.\\n \\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including \\nthe amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit \\nmarket conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in \\nreserving requirements, such as principles-based reserving, our inability to obtain reserve relief, changes in equity market levels, the \\nvalue of certain ﬁxed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that do not \\nget hedge accounting treatment, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC \\nformulas.  The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e., the amount of business without \\nguarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees).  In extreme scenarios of equity market declines, \\nthe amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our VUL insurance guarantees and variable annuity \\nguarantees may increase at a rate greater than the rate of change of the markets.  Increases in reserves reduce the statutory surplus used \\nin calculating our RBC ratios.  Most of these factors are outside of our control.  Our credit and insurer ﬁnancial strength ratings are \\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries.  The RBC ratio of \\nLNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and ﬁnancial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries.  For example, \\nshortly after our announcement in November 2022 that we expected decreases to our statutory capital and RBC ratio by the end of \\n2022, AM Best downgraded LNC’s short and long-term issuer credit ratings and the ﬁnancial strength ratings of LNL and LLANY, due \\nin part to a decrease in our capital, and revised its ratings outlooks from stable to negative for LNC and FPP, while Moody’s and Fitch \\nrevised their short and long-term issuer credit and ﬁnancial strength ratings outlooks for LNC and its insurance subsidiaries from stable \\nto negative.  See “Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Ratings” in the MD&A for a \\nfull description of our ratings and ratings outlooks, including our S&P ratings and outlooks, certain of which were also downgraded or \\nrevised in November 2022 prior to our above-referenced announcement.\\n \\nIn addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount \\nof statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.  For example, S&P has announced that it plans to propose \\nchanges to its insurer RBC capital adequacy model, which, depending on the ﬁnal changes, could increase the amount of statutory \\ncapital we are required to hold in order to maintain our current ratings.  To the extent that our statutory capital resources are deemed to \\nbe insufﬁcient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or \\nprivate equity or debt ﬁnancing, which may be on terms not as favorable as in the past.  \\n \\nAlternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in such a scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, \\nour ﬁnancial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies.  For more information on risks regarding \\nour ratings, see “Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our ﬁnancial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market \\nproducts, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” below.\\n \\nAn inability to access our credit facilities could result in a reduction in our liquidity and lead to downgrades in our credit and ﬁnancial \\nstrength ratings.\\n \\nWe rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity.  We also use the credit facilities as a potential backstop to provide \\nstatutory reserve credit.  Our credit facilities are available to provide reserve credit to LNL in such a case.  If we were unable to access \\nour facility in such circumstances, it could materially impact LNL’s capital position.  The availability of these facilities could be critical \\nto our credit and ﬁnancial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources \\nof credit are tight.  \\n \\nIn addition, our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or fulﬁll the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of \\nlenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under \\nthe terms 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 47/324 \\n \\n2530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 48/324Table of Contents\\n \\nof the facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse \\neffect on our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nAssumptions and Estimates\\n \\nAs a result of changes in assumptions, estimates and methods in calculating reserves, our reserves for future policy beneﬁts and claims \\nrelated to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate.\\n \\nWe establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future beneﬁts and claims.  For \\nour insurance products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, estimated \\npremiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policies, the timing of the events covered by the insurance policies, the lapse rate \\nof the policies, the amount of beneﬁts or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we \\nreceive.\\n \\nThe sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable universal life contracts and variable annuity base \\ncontracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline.  The sensitivity will be \\naffected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance.  Statutory reserves \\nfor variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force, and therefore, result in non-linear \\nrelationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period.\\n \\nThe assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, \\nwe cannot determine with precision the ultimate amount or the timing of the payment of actual beneﬁts and claims or whether the assets \\nsupporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of beneﬁts or claims.  If our actual experience is \\ndifferent from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future beneﬁts and \\nclaims, which would adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.  In addition, increases in reserves have a \\nnegative effect on income from operations in the quarter incurred and could also have a negative impact in future periods.  For example, \\nin the third quarter of 2022, we incurred a substantial charge related to the company’s annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions, \\nrelated primarily to updated lapse assumptions related to UL products with secondary guarantees in response to emerging experience, \\ncombined with recently validated external industry perspectives.  This charge also impacted our statutory capital in the fourth quarter of \\n2022.  For more information on our annual assumption review, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Annual Assumption \\nReview” in MD&A.  For information on impacts to our statutory capital, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Overview – Capital” \\nin the MD&A.\\n \\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax \\nassets.\\n \\nIf our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline or the price of our common stock does not increase, we \\nmay be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, \\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.  For example, during the third quarter of \\n2022, we recorded goodwill impairment of $634\\xa0million related to our Life Insurance segment.  Future reviews of goodwill could result \\nin an impairment of goodwill, and such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our net income and book value, although \\nthey would not affect the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries.    For more information on goodwill, see “Critical Accounting \\nPolicies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in the MD&A and Note 9.  \\n \\nIf, based on available information, including about the performance of a business and its ability to generate future capital gains, we \\ndetermine that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be \\nestablished with a corresponding charge to net income.  Such valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations and ﬁnancial condition.  For more information on our deferred income tax assets, see Note 6.\\n \\nThe determination of the amount of allowance for credit losses and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could \\nmaterially impact our results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation \\nand assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class.  Such evaluations and assessments are revised as \\nconditions change and new information becomes available.  Management updates its evaluations regularly and reﬂects changes in \\nallowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised.  There can be no assurance that our management has \\naccurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reﬂected in our ﬁnancial statements.  Furthermore, additional \\nimpairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future.  Historical trends may not be indicative of future \\nimpairments or allowances.\\n \\nWith respect to unrealized losses, we establish deferred tax assets for the tax beneﬁt we may receive in the event that losses are \\nrealized.  The realization of signiﬁcant realized losses could result in an inability to recover the tax beneﬁts and may result in the \\nestablishment of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.  Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse \\nimpact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.

Decreases in the estimated fair value of our \\nsecurities may harm our results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.  See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments” in \\nthe MD&A for additional information.  \\n \\nSigniﬁcant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for, reinsurance, which could adversely affect our \\nproﬁtability.\\n \\nWe reinsure a portion of the mortality risk on fully underwritten, newly issued, individual life insurance contracts.  We regularly review \\nretention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future.  In the event that we experience adverse mortality \\nor morbidity experience, a signiﬁcant portion of that is reimbursed by our reinsurers.  Prolonged or severe adverse mortality or \\nmorbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs and, ultimately, reinsurers being unwilling to offer future coverage.  If \\nwe are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance protection at comparable rates to what we are \\npaying currently, we may have to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reﬂect higher reinsurance premiums or \\nboth.  If this were to occur, we may be exposed to reduced proﬁtability and cash ﬂow strain or we may not be able to price new \\nbusiness at competitive rates.\\n \\nPandemics and other catastrophes have impacted, and may in the future, adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims.\\n \\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality and morbidity, such as that caused by a pandemic, an act of \\nterrorism, natural disaster or other event that causes a large number of deaths, injuries or illnesses.  In addition, in our group insurance \\noperations, an event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers, such as a pandemic or a natural \\ndisaster, could also cause a signiﬁcant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in the \\nﬁrst quarter of 2020, we experienced higher mortality claim payments due to an elevation in claim incidence.  In addition, we \\nexperienced an increase in short-term and long-term disability claims related to the pandemic.  This elevated level of claim incidence \\nnegatively impacted our earnings in each of the last three years.  We expect COVID-19-related mortality to continue to follow U.S. \\ndeath trends.  The likelihood, timing or severity of a future pandemic or other catastrophe cannot be predicted.  Additionally, the impact \\nof climate change has caused, and may continue to cause, changes in weather patterns, resulting in more severe and more frequent \\nnatural disasters such as forest ﬁres, hurricanes, tornados, ﬂoods and storm surges.  The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, or \\nfuture pandemics or other catastrophic events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, \\ndepending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nThe extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and \\nthe severity of the event.  Pandemics, natural disasters and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, may produce signiﬁcant \\ndamage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated.  Although our investment, product and physical exposures are \\ndiversiﬁed (e.g., geographically), reducing the enterprise impact to catastrophic events, claims resulting from natural or man-made \\ncatastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our ﬁnancial results for any ﬁscal quarter or year and could materially reduce \\nour proﬁtability or harm our ﬁnancial condition.  Also, catastrophic events could harm the ﬁnancial condition of our reinsurers and \\nthereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.  Accordingly, our ability to write new business could also be \\naffected.\\n \\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after \\nassessing the probable losses arising from the event.  We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established or applicable \\nreinsurance will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities, and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\n \\nOperational Matters\\n \\nWe may not realize or sustain all of the beneﬁts we expect from the Spark Initiative, our investments associated with the initiative could \\nbe greater than expected, and our efforts with respect to the initiative may result in disruption of our businesses or distraction of our \\nmanagement and employees, which could have a material effect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nIn November 2021, we formally communicated a new expense savings initiative, the Spark Initiative, focused on driving efﬁciencies \\nthroughout all aspects of our business, from leveraging automation to simplifying and improving process efﬁciency.  In addition, this \\nprogram is targeting beneﬁts beyond cost savings, including improving the way we work by focusing on reskilling and upskilling our \\nvaluable employee base.  The multi-year program will require signiﬁcant investment and resource prioritization.  If we do not \\nsuccessfully manage and execute the Spark Initiative, or if the program is inadequate or ineffective, we may not achieve all of the cost \\nsavings we expect from the initiative, or projected savings may be delayed or not sustained.  In addition, our investments related to the \\nprogram may be greater than expected, and the work we are undertaking with respect to the initiative could result in disruption of our 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 51/324business or distraction of our management and employees.

Many of our methods of managing risk \\nand exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models.  As a result, these \\nmethods may not predict future exposures, which could be signiﬁcantly greater than the historical measures indicate, such as the risk of \\npandemics causing a large number of deaths.  Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding \\nmarkets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always \\nbe accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.  Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other \\nthings, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and \\nprocedures may not be fully effective.\\n \\nWe face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of \\noperations.\\n \\nWe follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies \\nwritten by our insurance subsidiaries (known as “ceding”).  As of December 31, 2022, we ceded $831.5 billion of life insurance in force \\nto reinsurers for reinsurance protection.  Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay \\ncontract holders for losses insured under the policies we issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance \\nsubsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  For more information regarding our reinsurance arrangements and exposure, see \\n“Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 8.   \\n \\nThe collectability of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers.  We perform due diligence on all \\nreinsurers, including, but not limited to, a review of creditworthiness prior to entering into any reinsurance transaction, and we review \\nour reinsurers on an ongoing basis to monitor credit ratings.  To support balances due and allow reserve credit when reinsurance is \\nobtained from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions, we also require assets in trust, LOCs or other \\nacceptable collateral.  Despite these measures, the insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a \\nreinsurance contract by a large reinsurer or multiple reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and \\nﬁnancial condition.  For information on reinsurance-related credit losses, see Note 8.\\n \\nReinsurers also may attempt to increase rates with respect to our existing reinsurance arrangements.  The ability of our reinsurers to \\nincrease rates depends upon the terms of each reinsurance contract.  Some of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions that limit the \\nreinsurer’s ability to increase rates on in-force business.  An increase in reinsurance rates may affect the proﬁtability of our insurance \\nbusiness.  Additionally, such a rate increase could result in our recapture of the business, which may result in a need for additional \\nreserves and increase our exposure to claims.  In recent years, we have faced a number of rate increase actions on in-force business, and \\nreinsurers have initiated, and may in the future initiate, legal proceedings against us.  Our management of these rate increase actions \\nand the outcomes of legal proceedings have not to date had a material effect on our results of operations or ﬁnancial condition, but we \\ncan make no assurance regarding the impact of future rate increase actions or outcomes of legal proceedings.  See Note 13 for a \\ndescription of reinsurance-related actions. \\n \\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our \\nbusiness.\\n \\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualiﬁed employees.  Intense competition exists for employees \\nwith demonstrated ability, and the competition for talent has increased during the last two years.  In addition, opportunities to work \\nremotely have expanded the reach of recruiters and options for employees.  As a result of this competition, we may be unable to hire or \\nretain the qualiﬁed employees we need to support our business.  Further, the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key \\nemployees could have a material adverse effect on our operations due to their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry \\nexperience and the potential difﬁculty of promptly ﬁnding qualiﬁed replacement employees.  We compete with other ﬁnancial \\ninstitutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and ﬁnancial condition.  Sales in our businesses and \\nour results of operations and ﬁnancial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining \\nemployees, including ﬁnancial advisers, wholesalers and other employees, as well as independent distributors of our products.\\n \\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\\n \\nWe may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property, which represents a diversion of resources that may be \\nsigniﬁcant and may not prove successful.  The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection \\nof our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.\\n \\nWe also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another \\nparty’s intellectual property rights.  If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we \\ncould incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our \\ncustomers, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 53/324 \\n \\n \\n2830/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 54/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nOur information systems may experience interruptions, breaches in security and/or a failure of disaster recovery systems that could \\nresult in a loss or disclosure of conﬁdential information, damage to our reputation, impairment of our ability to conduct business \\neffectively and increased expense.\\n \\nOur information systems are critical to the operation of our business.  We collect, process, maintain, retain and distribute large amounts \\nof personal ﬁnancial and health information and other conﬁdential and sensitive data about our customers in the ordinary course of our \\nbusiness.  Our business therefore depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information.  Any failure, \\ninterruption or breach in security could result in disruptions to our critical systems and adversely affect our customer relationships.  In \\naddition, our ﬂexible hybrid work model, which allows the majority of our employees to work remotely on a regular basis, could \\nincrease our operational risk in these areas, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks, discussed further below.\\n \\nPublicly reported cyber-security threats and incidents have increased over recent periods, including a proliferation of ransomware \\nattacks.  Although our computer systems have in the past been, and will likely in the future be, subject to or targets of unauthorized or \\nfraudulent access, to date, we have not had a material security breach.  While we employ a robust and tested information security \\nprogram, the preventative actions we take to reduce the incidence and severity of cyber incidents and protect our information \\ntechnology may be insufﬁcient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks, including ransomware and malware attacks, \\nattacks targeting remote workers, compromised credentials, fraud, other security breaches or other unauthorized access to our computer \\nsystems, and, given the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, in some cases, such incidents could occur and persist for an extended \\nperiod of time without detection.  As a result, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not \\noccur or, if any does occur, that it will be detected in a timely manner or that it can be sufﬁciently remediated.  Such an occurrence may \\nimpede or interrupt our business operations, adversely affect our reputation or lead to increased expense, any of which could adversely \\naffect our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.\\n \\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, pandemic, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist \\nattack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our \\nability to conduct business and on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, particularly if those problems affect our computer-\\nbased data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data.  In addition, in the event that a signiﬁcant \\nnumber of our managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely \\ncompromised.  These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods and services and our employees’ \\nability to perform their job responsibilities.\\n \\nThe failure of our computer systems and/or our disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause signiﬁcant interruptions in our \\noperations and result in a failure to maintain the security, conﬁdentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information \\nrelating to our customers.  The occurrence of any such failure, interruption or security breach of our systems could damage our \\nreputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and ﬁnancial \\nliability.  Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our \\ncustomer data, we may also have obligations to notify affected individuals about the incident, and we may need to provide some form \\nof remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident.  For more information, see \\n“Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – State Regulation – Compliance with existing and emerging privacy regulations could result in \\nincreased compliance costs and/or lead to changes in business practices and policies, and any failure to protect the conﬁdentiality of \\npersonal information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and \\nresults of operations.” \\n \\nAlthough we conduct due diligence, negotiate contractual provisions and, in many cases, conduct periodic reviews of our vendors, \\ndistributors, and other third parties that provide operational or information technology services to us to conﬁrm compliance with our \\ninformation security standards, the failure of such third parties’ computer systems and/or their disaster recovery plans for any reason \\nmight cause signiﬁcant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, conﬁdentiality or privacy of \\nsensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers.

This could lead to a decrease in fees as net outﬂows of assets increase, and therefore, result in lower fee income and \\nlower spread income.  Furthermore, sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses, depending on \\nmarket conditions.  The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings.  A downgrade of our debt \\nratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt, including bank lines of credit, with terms and conditions similar to our current \\ndebt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.\\n \\nOur ratings and the ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating \\nagencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or we can maintain our current ratings.  See \\n“Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Ratings” in the MD&A for a description of our \\nratings.  See also “A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and \\ninsurer ﬁnancial strength ratings” above.\\n \\nCertain blocks of our insurance business purchased from third-party insurers under indemnity reinsurance agreements may require us \\nto place assets in trust, secure letters of credit or return the business, if the ﬁnancial strength ratings and/or capital ratios of certain \\ninsurance subsidiaries are not maintained at speciﬁed levels.\\n \\nUnder certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, two of our insurance subsidiaries, LNL and LLANY, provide 100% indemnity \\nreinsurance for the business assumed; however, the third-party insurer, or the “cedent,” remains primarily liable on the underlying \\ninsurance business.  These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our subsidiary, as the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer \\nﬁnancial strength ratings and capital ratios.  If these ratings or capital ratios are not maintained, depending upon the reinsurance \\nagreement, the cedent may recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide LOCs at least equal to the relevant \\nstatutory reserves.  See “Item 1. Business – Reinsurance” for a discussion of the indemnity reinsurance arrangements and the ﬁnancial \\nstrength ratings and/or capital ratios that are required to be maintained under such arrangements.  As of December 31, 2022, LNL’s and \\nLLANY’s ﬁnancial strength ratings and RBC ratios exceeded the ratings and ratios required under each agreement.  See “Item 1. \\nBusiness – Financial Strength Ratings” for a description of our ﬁnancial strength ratings.  See “Reinsurance” in the MD&A for \\nadditional information on these indemnity reinsurance agreements.\\n \\nIf the cedent recaptured the business, LNL and LLANY would be required to release reserves and transfer assets to the cedent.  Such a \\nrecapture could adversely impact our future proﬁts.  Alternatively, if LNL and LLANY established a security trust for the cedent, the \\nability to transfer assets out of the trust could be severely restricted, thus negatively impacting our liquidity.\\n \\nInvestments\\n \\nWe may have difﬁculty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio in a timely manner and realizing full value. \\n \\nWe hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as privately placed securities, mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, \\nlimited partnership interests and other investments.

In addition, \\nbecause these funds, and private equity investments, do not trade on public markets and indications of realizable market value may not \\nbe readily available, valuations can be infrequent and/or more volatile.  As a result, the amount of income that we record from these \\ninvestments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter, and a sudden or sustained decline in the markets or valuation of one or more \\nsubstantial investments could result in lower than expected returns earned by our investment portfolio and thereby adversely impact our \\nearnings.\\n \\nDefaults on our mortgage loans and write-downs of mortgage equity may adversely affect our proﬁtability.\\n \\nOur mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial properties.  The performance of our mortgage \\nloan investments may ﬂuctuate in the future.  In addition, some of our mortgage loan investments have balloon payment maturities.  An \\nincrease in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations \\nand ﬁnancial condition.  Further, any geographic or sector exposure in our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment \\nportfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.  While we seek to mitigate this risk by \\nhaving a broadly diversiﬁed portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector \\nmay have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are exposed.\\n \\nThe difﬁculties faced by other ﬁnancial institutions could adversely affect us.\\n \\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the \\nﬁnancial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutions.  Many of these \\ntransactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.  In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our \\ncredit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufﬁcient to recover the \\nfull amount of the related loan or derivative exposure.  We also may have exposure to these ﬁnancial institutions in the form of \\nunsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and/or equity investments.  These parties may default on their obligations to us due \\nto bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, corporate governance issues or \\nother reasons.  A downturn in the U.S. or other economies could result in increased impairments.  There can be no assurance that any \\nsuch losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business and results of \\noperations.\\n \\nOur requirements to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market value of speciﬁed assets may adversely affect our \\nliquidity and expose us to counterparty credit risk.\\n \\nMany of our transactions with ﬁnancial and other institutions, including settling futures positions, specify the circumstances under \\nwhich the parties are required to post collateral.  The amount of collateral we may be required to post under these agreements may \\nincrease under certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity.  In addition, under the terms of some of our \\ntransactions, we may be required to make payments to our counterparties related to any decline in the market value of the speciﬁed \\nassets.\\n \\nThe elimination of LIBOR may affect the value of certain derivatives and ﬂoating rate securities we hold or have issued.\\n \\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the \\nFCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  On March 5, 2021, the FCA \\nannounced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any benchmark administrator, or no longer be representative (a) \\nimmediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar settings; and (b) immediately after June 30, \\n2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings.  Since the initial announcement in 2017, we have been monitoring \\ndevelopments, determining how our hedging strategies, asset portfolio, liabilities, systems and operations may be affected by the \\ntransition and taking actions to prepare for the transition to a post-LIBOR environment.  In December 2022, the Federal Reserve Board \\nadopted regulations implementing the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) by identifying the \\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that, after June 30, 2023, will replace LIBOR in certain ﬁnancial \\ncontracts that do not have adequate interest rate fallback provisions.  Although we have taken actions to mitigate many of the potential \\nrisks, the transition to alternative reference rates may still adversely affect the value of certain derivatives and ﬂoating rate securities we \\nhold and the value of our remaining outstanding ﬂoating rate capital securities.  The ultimate effect of the discontinuation of LIBOR on \\nnew or existing ﬁnancial instruments, liabilities or operational processes will vary depending on a number of factors, including the \\nfallback provisions in contracts; adoption of replacement language or application of the LIBOR Act regulations in contracts where such \\nlanguage is currently absent; potential changes in spreads causing valuation changes; treatment of hedge effectiveness; and impacts on \\nour models and systems.

We compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality \\nof investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived ﬁnancial strength and claims-paying and credit \\nratings.  Our competitors include insurers, broker-dealers, investment advisers, asset managers, hedge funds and other ﬁnancial \\ninstitutions.  A number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have \\nhigher ﬁnancial strength or credit ratings than we do.  In recent years, there has been consolidation and convergence among companies \\nin the ﬁnancial services industry resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized ﬁnancial services ﬁrms.  Many of these \\nﬁrms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements.  Furthermore, larger \\ncompetitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their ﬁnancial strength ratings, \\nthereby allowing them to price their products more competitively.  Our customers and clients may engage other ﬁnancial service \\nproviders, and the resulting loss of business may harm our results of operations or ﬁnancial condition. \\n \\nOur sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors.\\n \\nWe sell our life insurance and annuity products through independent sales representatives.  These representatives are not captive, which \\nmeans they may also sell our competitors’ products.  If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher \\ncommission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors’ \\nproducts instead of ours.\\n \\nItem 1B.

A forward-looking statement is a \\nstatement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future \\nresults, performance or achievements.  Forward-looking statements may contain words like: “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” \\n“expect,” “project,” “shall,” “will” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating \\nor ﬁnancial performance.  In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services \\nor products, future performance or ﬁnancial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.  We claim the \\nprotection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. \\n \\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or \\nimplied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: \\n \\n\\x00Weak general economic and business conditions that may affect demand for our products, account values, investment results, \\nguaranteed beneﬁt liabilities, premium levels and claims experience; \\n\\x00Adverse global capital and credit market conditions that may affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to \\nrealize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred \\ntax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our ﬁnancial condition and ability to raise additional capital or reﬁnance \\nexisting debt as it matures;

Moreover, we \\noperate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for \\nmanagement to predict all such risk factors. \\n \\nFurther, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of \\nfactors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and \\nuncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  In addition, we \\ndisclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reﬂect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this \\nreport.  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION\\n \\nExecutive Summary \\n \\nWe are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies.  We sell a wide \\nrange of wealth protection, accumulation, group protection and retirement income products and solutions through our four business \\nsegments: \\n \\n\\x00Life Insurance;\\n\\x00Annuities;\\n\\x00Group Protection; and \\n\\x00Retirement Plan Services\\n \\nWe also have Other Operations, which includes the ﬁnancial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  \\nSee “Part I – Item 1. Business” above for a discussion of our business segments and products. \\n \\nIn this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and \\nincome (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the proﬁtability of our operating \\nsegments.  Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the ﬁnancial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess \\nthe results of our segments.  Accordingly, we deﬁne and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in \\nNote 21.  Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing \\nbusinesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses.  Certain items are \\nexcluded from operating revenue and income (loss) from operations because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of \\ncurrent operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items \\ndo not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.

Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.  \\n \\nIndustry Trends\\n \\nWe continue to be inﬂuenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry. \\n \\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\\n \\nThe health, economic and business conditions precipitated by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 continued to \\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition during 2022.  While various treatments and vaccines are now \\navailable, COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, which could prolong or lead to increased hospitalization and death rates.  We \\ncontinue to monitor U.S. CDC reports related to COVID-19 and the potential continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our \\nLife Insurance and Group Protection segments.  See “Results of Life Insurance” and “Results of Group Protection” below for impacts \\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic.  \\n \\nInterest Rate Environment \\n \\nThroughout 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate target range to combat inﬂation.  In February 2023, the Federal \\nReserve announced an additional 25 basis points increase, when it set the range at 4.50% to 4.75% and reiterated its commitment to \\nimplement and maintain policy as needed to bring inﬂation down.  Additionally, the Federal Reserve has continued reducing its balance \\nsheet, which started in June 2022, by not reinvesting Treasury securities, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.  As \\ninterest rates rise, which improves the yield on our new money and ﬂoating rate investments, we continue to be proactive in our \\ninvestment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies, expense management actions and overall asset-liability practices to \\nmitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this interest rate environment.  \\n \\nWe have provided disclosures around risks related to increases in interest rate risk in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market \\nConditions – Increases in interest rates may negatively affect our proﬁtability, capital position and the value of our investment portfolio \\nand may also result in increased contract withdrawals,” “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Annual Assumption Review – \\nLong-Term New Money Investment Yield Sensitivity” below and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About \\nMarket Risk – Interest Rate Risk.” \\n \\nRegulatory Environment\\n \\nU.S.-domiciled insurance entities are regulated at the state level, while certain products and services are also subject to federal \\nregulation.  Regulators may reﬁne capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry.  \\nRegulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially affect the capital requirements and proﬁtability of the industry \\nand result in increased regulation and oversight for the industry.  In August 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed by the \\nU.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden.  The Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 established a new 15% corporate \\nalternative minimum tax for corporations whose average adjusted net income for any consecutive three-year period beginning after \\nDecember 31, 2022, exceeds $1.0 billion.  The Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 also established a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases \\nmade by publicly traded corporations.

In addition, the Spark \\nInitiative targets beneﬁts beyond cost savings including improving the way we work by focusing on reskilling and upskilling our \\nvaluable employee base.   \\n \\nDuring 2022, we recognized beneﬁts of $22 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax, net of investments, as a result of these initiatives.  In 2023, \\nwe expect to realize beneﬁts of approximately $60 million to $100 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax, net of investments.  We ultimately \\nexpect to realize annual beneﬁts of approximately $260 million to $300 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax, net of investments, by the end of \\n2024. \\n \\n \\nFor risks related to the Spark Initiative, see “Part I – Item 1A.

We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to \\nselected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities \\nassociated with guaranteed beneﬁt riders available in our variable annuity products.  The hedge program in effect through December \\n31, 2022, was highly effective and focused on generating sufﬁcient assets to fund future claims with a goal of minimizing the volatility \\nof net income under United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  In September 2022, we announced \\nenhancements to our variable annuity hedge program that continues to focus on generating sufﬁcient assets to fund future claims with a \\ngoal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital.  The revised variable annuity hedge program, effective \\nJanuary 1, 2023, aligns with our increased strategic focus on maximizing the economic value as measured by distributable earnings, \\nwhich is achieved by managing risks to statutory capital generation due to market volatility.  For risks related to our variable annuity \\nhedge program, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Our hedging strategies may not be fully effective to offset \\nthe changes in the carrying value of the guarantees on certain of our products, which could result in volatility in our results of \\noperations and ﬁnancial condition under GAAP and in the capital levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.”\\n \\nTargeted Annual Operating Earnings Per Share Growth\\n \\nGrowth in operating earnings per share (“EPS”) is a key driver of our long-term performance.

Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  On an ongoing basis, we \\nevaluate our assumptions, estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be \\nreasonable under the circumstances.  For a detailed discussion of other signiﬁcant accounting policies, see Note 1.\\n \\nThe processes, judgments and estimates described herein relate to the accounting standards in effect through December 31, 2022.

DAC for variable annuity and deferred \\nﬁxed annuity contracts and universal life insurance (“UL”) and VUL policies is amortized over the expected lives of the contracts in \\nrelation to the incidence of EGPs derived from the contracts.    \\n \\nEGPs vary based on a number of factors, including assumptions about policy persistency, mortality, fee income, investment margins, \\nexpense margins and realized gains and losses on investments.  When actual gross proﬁts are higher in the period than EGPs, we \\nrecognize more amortization than planned.  When actual gross proﬁts are lower in the period than EGPs, we recognize less amortization \\nthan planned.  In a calendar year where the gross proﬁts for a certain group of policies, or “cohorts,” are negative, our\\xa0actuarial \\nprocess\\xa0limits, or ﬂoors, the amortization expense offset to zero.  For a discussion of the periods over which we amortize our DAC, \\nVOBA, DSI and DFEL see “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1.\\n \\nDuring the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models used for our \\nEGPs underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL that may result in unlocking of assumptions.  See “Annual \\nAssumption Review” below for more information. \\n \\nReversion to the Mean\\n \\nBecause returns within the variable sub-accounts (“variable funds”) have a signiﬁcant effect on the value of variable annuity and VUL \\nproducts and the fees earned on these accounts, EGPs could increase or decrease with movements in variable fund returns.  Signiﬁcant 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 74/324 \\n \\n4230/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 75/324Table of Contents\\n \\nand sustained changes in variable funds have had and could in the future have an effect on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization \\nprimarily within our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Life Insurance segment. \\n \\nAs variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, \\nwhich we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process.  Under our RTM process, future EGPs are projected using stochastic \\nmodeling of a large number of market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates, interest rate spreads and mortality \\nrates to develop a statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity products.  Because variable fund \\nreturns are unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate projections of future EGPs need not be affected by \\nrandom short-term and insigniﬁcant deviations from expectations in variable fund returns.  However, long-term or signiﬁcant deviations \\nfrom expected variable fund returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL \\nand changes in future contract beneﬁts.  The statistical distribution is designed to identify when the deviations from expected returns \\nhave become signiﬁcant enough to warrant a change of the future variable fund growth rate assumption.  \\n \\nAs discussed above, stochastic modeling is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs.  We compare the range of the \\npresent value of the future EGPs from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization model.  A set of intervals around the \\nmean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible EGPs.  These intervals are then \\ncompared to the present value of the EGPs used in the amortization model.  If the present value of EGPs utilized for amortization were \\nto exceed the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used to calculate amortization would be \\nconsidered.  If a revision is deemed necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at the end of the \\nperiod during which the revision occurred along with a long-term variable fund growth rate assumption such that the re-projected EGPs \\nwould be our best estimate of EGPs.\\n \\nOur practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the ﬁrst of the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay \\nbetween the ﬁrst and second statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock.  Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a \\nresult of a short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock.  However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more \\nthan one quarter, it is likely that we would unlock.  While this approach reduces adjustments to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to \\nshort-term ﬂuctuations, signiﬁcant changes in variable fund returns that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a signiﬁcant \\nfavorable or unfavorable unlocking.  Notwithstanding these intervals, if a severe decline or increase in variable fund values were to \\noccur or should other circumstances suggest that the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could \\ndetermine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.\\n \\nOur long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization \\nfor the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate increase of approximately 2% followed by \\ngrowth going forward of 6.5% to 8.25% depending on the block of business and reﬂecting differences in contract holder fund \\nallocations between ﬁxed-income and equity-type investments.  If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of December\\xa031, 2022, we \\nwould have recorded unfavorable unlocking of approximately $90\\xa0million, pre-tax, primarily within our Annuities segment.\\n \\nInvestments\\n \\nInvestments are an integral part of our operations, and we invest in ﬁxed maturity securities that are primarily classiﬁed as AFS and \\ncarried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost due to factors other than credit loss included in stockholders’ equity as a \\ncomponent of AOCI.  The difference between amortized cost and fair value due to credit loss impairment is recognized in realized gain \\n(loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We also invest in equity securities that are carried at fair value \\nwith changes in fair value recognized in realized gain (loss).  See “Consolidated Investments” below for more information.  \\n \\nInvestment Valuation \\n \\nOur measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include \\ninherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or NPR, which would include our own credit risk.  Our estimate of an exchange \\nprice is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability (“exit price”) in the \\nprincipal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as opposed to the \\nprice that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a liability (“entry price”).  We categorize our ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair \\nvalue into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The three-level \\nhierarchy for fair value measurement is deﬁned in Note 1.  \\n \\n \\n \\n4330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 76/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe following summarizes investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value \\nhierarchy level (in millions) as of December\\xa031, 2022:\\n \\n  \\n                 \\n                 \\n  Quoted             \\n  Prices             \\n  in Active             \\n Markets for Signiﬁcant Signiﬁcant    \\n  Identical ObservableUnobservable    \\n  Assets  Inputs  Inputs  Total  \\n  (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)  Fair Value  \\nPriced by third-party pricing services  $  400  $  86,156  $  162  $  86,718 \\nPriced by independent broker quotations   -    -    4,297    4,297 \\nPriced by matrices    -    16,506    -    16,506 \\nPriced by other methods (1)   -    -    261    261 \\nTotal  $  400  $ 102,662  $  4,720  $ 107,782 \\n                 \\nPercent of total   0%   95%   5%   100% \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n(1)Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value. \\n \\nFor the categories and associated fair value of our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities classiﬁed within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as \\nof December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, see Notes 1 and 20. \\n \\nOur investments are valued using the appropriate market inputs based on the investment type, and include benchmark yields, reported \\ntrades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In addition, \\nmarket indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met.  We \\nincorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, given the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to maturity.  \\nWe use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we do not adjust prices received from third \\nparties or obtain multiple prices when measuring the fair value of our investments.  We generally use prices from the pricing service \\nrather than broker quotes because we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs they use, as \\ncompared to the limited information on the pricing inputs from broker quotes.  For private placement securities, we use pricing matrices \\nthat utilize observable pricing inputs of similar public securities and Treasury yields as inputs to the fair value measurement.  It is \\npossible that different valuation techniques and models, other than those described above, could produce materially different estimates \\nof fair value. \\n \\nWhen the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has signiﬁcantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the \\nasset or liability, we believe that the market is not active.  Activities that may indicate a market is not active include fewer recent \\ntransactions in the market, price quotations that lack current information and/or vary substantially over time or among market makers, \\nlimited public information, uncorrelated indexes with recent fair values of assets and abnormally wide bid-ask spread.  As of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive.  We will continue to \\nre-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.\\n \\nWe use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing \\ninformation.  We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certiﬁcates of deposit and \\ncollateralized debt obligations when sufﬁcient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation.  \\nFor broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as \\nmarket participants.  Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-\\ndealer recognized as a market participant.  Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classiﬁed as Level 3 of the fair value \\nhierarchy.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, we used broker quotes for 47 securities as our ﬁnal price source, representing less than 1% of \\ntotal securities owned. \\n \\nIn order to validate the pricing information and broker quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with \\nsimilar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales and observations of general market movements for those security \\nclasses.  Our primary third-party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that it is using objectively veriﬁable observable \\nmarket data.  The pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered, including broker quotes, executed \\ntrades and credit information, as applicable.  If the pricing service determines it does not have sufﬁcient objectively veriﬁable \\ninformation about a security’s valuation, it discontinues providing a valuation for the security.  The pricing service regularly publishes \\nand updates a summary of inputs used in its valuations by major security type.  In addition, we have policies and procedures in place to \\nreview the process that is utilized by the third-party pricing service and the output that is provided to us by the pricing service.  On a \\nperiodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service, and we 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 77/324perform a comparison of the pricing service output to an alternative pricing source.  In addition, we check prices provided by our \\nprimary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for\\xa0unusual changes from period to \\nperiod based on certain\\xa0parameters\\xa0or for lack of change from one period to the next.  If such anomalies in the pricing are observed, we \\nmay use pricing information from another pricing source.  \\n \\n \\n4430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 78/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nValuation of Alternative Investments\\n \\nRecognition of investment income on alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related ﬁnancial statements, which \\nare generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners, as our venture capital, real estate and oil and gas portfolios are generally \\nreported to us on a three-month delay, and our hedge funds are reported to us on a one-month delay.  In addition, the effect of annual \\naudit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year ﬁnancial statement audits of the investees are typically received during the ﬁrst \\nor second quarter of each calendar year.  Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period \\nmay not include the complete effect of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period.  \\nRecorded audit adjustments affect our investment income on alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are recorded.  \\n \\nMeasurement of Allowances for Credit Losses and Recognition of Impairments\\n \\nWe regularly review our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related.  Realized \\ngains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience.  In the process of \\nevaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reﬂects declines that are related to credit losses, we consider our ability and intent \\nto sell the security prior to a recovery of value.  However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of \\noverall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance.  Although our \\nportfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses \\nattributable to factors other than credit loss until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a \\nsubsequent decision to sell.  These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classiﬁcation of our investment portfolio as AFS.  We \\nexpect to continue to manage all non-trading investments within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS \\nclassiﬁcation. \\n \\nWe consider economic factors and circumstances within industries and countries where recent impairments have occurred in our \\nassessment of the position of securities we own of similarly situated issuers.  While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a \\nparticular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other \\nrisks inherent in managing an investment portfolio.  Once identiﬁed, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and \\nmanage these risks.  The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within speciﬁc \\nﬁnancial and business markets, risks within speciﬁc industries and risks associated with related parties.  When the detailed analysis by \\nour external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is due to \\ncredit loss, a credit loss allowance is recorded.  In instances where declines are related to factors other than credit loss, the security will \\ncontinue to be carefully monitored.  \\n \\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether an investment shows indications of impairment.  These include \\nsubsequent signiﬁcant changes in general overall economic conditions, as well as speciﬁc business conditions affecting particular \\nissuers, future ﬁnancial market effects such as interest rate spreads, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating \\nagency actions and signiﬁcant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments.  In \\naddition, there are often signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values of securities as described in \\n“Investment Valuation” above.  We continually monitor developments and update underlying assumptions and ﬁnancial models based \\nupon new information. \\n \\nFor certain securitized ﬁxed maturity AFS securities with contractual cash ﬂows, including asset-backed securities (“ABS”), we use our \\nbest estimate of cash ﬂows for the life of the security to determine whether it is credit impaired.  In addition, we review for other \\nindicators of impairment as required by the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards \\nCodiﬁcationTM (“ASC”).\\n \\nWrite-downs on real estate and other investments are experienced when the estimated value of the asset is deemed to be less than the \\ncarrying value.\\xa0 Write-downs and allowance for credit losses for commercial mortgage loans are established when the estimated value \\nof the asset is deemed to be less than the carrying value.  All commercial mortgage loans that are impaired are individually reviewed to \\ndetermine an appropriate credit loss allowance.  Changing economic conditions affect our valuation of commercial mortgage loans.  \\nIncreasing vacancies, declining rents and the like are incorporated into the allowance for credit losses analysis that we perform for \\nmonitored loans and may contribute to an increase in the allowance for credit losses.  In addition, we continue to monitor the entire \\ncommercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify both current and projected future risk based on reasonable and supportable forecasts.  \\nAreas of emphasis include properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt-service coverage and/or loan-to-value \\nreduction.  Where warranted, we have established or increased our allowance for credit losses based upon this analysis.\\n \\nWe have also established an allowance for credit losses on our residential mortgage loan portfolio that includes a speciﬁc credit loss \\nallowance for loans that are deemed to be impaired as well as an allowance for credit losses for pools of loans with similar risk \\ncharacteristics.  The allowance for credit losses for the performing population of loans is based on historical performance for similar \\nloans, as well as projected future losses based on modeling, which includes reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The historical data \\nutilized in the allowance for credit losses calculation process is adjusted for current economic conditions.\\n \\nAmortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reﬂect an assumption for an expected level of \\ncredit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 79/324DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reﬂecting the incremental effect of actual \\n \\n \\n4530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 80/324Table of Contents\\n \\nversus expected credit-related investment losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net \\nrealized gains and losses. \\n \\nDerivatives \\n \\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes.  We hedge certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk, basis \\nrisk, equity market risk, credit risk and foreign currency exchange risk by entering into derivative transactions.  We also purchase and \\nissue ﬁnancial instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments.  See “Future Contract Beneﬁts” and “Other Contract Holder \\nFunds” below for information on embedded derivatives.  Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the \\ncarrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates.  \\n \\nWe carry our derivative instruments at fair value, which we determine through valuation techniques or models that use market data \\ninputs or independent broker quotations.  The fair values ﬂuctuate from period to period due to the volatility of the valuation inputs, \\nincluding but not limited to swap interest rates, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels, foreign currency forward and spot \\nrates, credit spreads and correlations, some of which are signiﬁcantly affected by economic conditions.  The effect to revenue is \\nreported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income (loss) from \\noperations of our segments.  \\n \\nFor more information on derivatives, see Notes 1 and 5.  For more information on market exposures associated with our derivatives, \\nincluding sensitivities, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” \\n \\nFuture Contract Beneﬁts \\n \\nReserves\\n \\nReserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain \\nassumed rates, are calculated to be sufﬁcient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.  Generally, the reserves \\nin excess of account value are reported within future contract beneﬁts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Establishing adequate \\nreserves for our obligations to contract holders requires assumptions to be made that are intended to represent an estimation of \\nexperience for the period that policy beneﬁts are payable.  If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves \\nshould be adequate to provide for future beneﬁts and expenses.  If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be \\nrequired.  Signiﬁcant assumptions include mortality rates, morbidity, policy persistency and interest rates.  We periodically review our \\nexperience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.  \\n \\nGLB\\n \\nWe have certain GLB variable annuity products with GWB and GIB features that are embedded derivatives.  Certain features of these \\nguarantees have elements of both insurance beneﬁts accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and \\nLiabilities for Future Policy Beneﬁts Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“beneﬁt reserves”) and embedded derivative reserves.  We calculate \\nthe value of the embedded derivative reserve and the beneﬁt reserve based on the speciﬁc characteristics of each GLB feature.  Through \\nour hybrid accounting approach, for reserve calculation purposes we assign product cash ﬂows to the embedded derivative or insurance \\nportion of the reserves based on the life-contingent nature of the beneﬁts.  We report the insurance portion of the reserves in future \\ncontract beneﬁts with the embedded derivative reported in either other assets or other liabilities.  During the third quarter of each year, \\nwe conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying our reserves and embedded derivatives.  \\nSee “Annual Assumption Review” below for more information.  These embedded derivatives are valued based on a stochastic \\nprojection of scenarios of the embedded derivative cash ﬂows.  The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to \\nbe appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, actuarial lapse, beneﬁt utilization, \\nmortality, risk margin, administrative expenses and a margin for proﬁt.  In addition, an NPR component is determined at each valuation \\ndate that reﬂects our risk of not fulﬁlling the obligations of the underlying liability.  The spread for the NPR is added to the discount \\nrates used in determining the fair value from the net cash ﬂows.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be \\nused by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  These embedded \\nderivatives are carried at fair value and are all classiﬁed as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  It is possible that different valuation \\ntechniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  Changes in the fair value of these embedded \\nderivatives result primarily from changes in market conditions.  For more information, see Notes 1 and 20.\\n \\nWe have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity \\nmarkets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities associated with GWB and GIB features that are available in our variable annuity \\nproducts.  In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal \\nof accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these beneﬁts.\\n \\n \\n \\n4630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 81/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nChanges in the value of the hedge contracts hedge the income statement effect of changes in GLB embedded derivative reserves and \\nbeneﬁt reserves.  This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options and total return swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, and futures on \\nU.S.-based and international equity indices, as well as interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency futures.  The notional \\namounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to \\nchanges in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the GLB embedded \\nderivative reserves and beneﬁt reserves caused by changes in equity markets, as well as the change in GLB embedded derivative \\nreserves caused by changes in interest rates and implied volatilities.  See “Realized Gain (Loss) – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives \\nResults” below for information on how we determine our NPR, including the sensitivity of the NPR factor.\\n \\nAs part of our hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market-implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis.  \\nWe rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed.  While we actively manage our hedge positions, these \\npositions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of embedded derivative reserves and beneﬁt reserves caused by \\nmovements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and \\ncorresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities, \\nrealized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging \\nindices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging \\ninstruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off.   \\n \\nWithin our annuity business, we have certain products that contain GLB features.  The proportion of our variable annuity account \\nvalues that contained GLB features to our total annuity account values, net of reinsurance, was 45% and 50% as of December\\xa031, 2022 \\nand 2021, respectively.  Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential beneﬁts with the GLB features.  A contract \\nwith a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account value falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or \\nincome beneﬁts, assuming no lapses.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, 37% and 7%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a \\nGLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, was $3.1 billion and \\n$453\\xa0million, respectively.  However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of beneﬁts over the \\naccount value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount.  If, after \\nthe series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of \\nannuity payments.  The account value can also ﬂuctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases \\nin the excess of the present value of beneﬁts over account value.\\n \\nAs a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GLB guarantees is uncertain and could be signiﬁcantly more \\nor less than $3.1 billion, net of reinsurance.  Our fair value estimates of the GLB embedded derivatives, which are based on detailed \\nmodels of future cash ﬂows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reﬂect a more comprehensive view of the related factors \\nand represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities.  The market-consistent scenarios used in\\xa0the \\ndetermination of the fair value of the GLB embedded derivatives are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives \\nfor which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  We use risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations in \\nour calculation to value the entire block of guarantees, which involve 100 unique scenarios per policy or approximately 44\\xa0million \\nscenarios.  The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical \\nmarket participant.  The market-consistent inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions for capital markets (e.g., implied \\nvolatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), contract holder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, rider utilization, etc.), \\nmortality, risk margins, maintenance expenses and a margin for proﬁt.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that \\nwould be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  It is \\npossible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  For \\ninformation on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) – Variable Annuity Net \\nDerivatives Results” below. \\n \\n \\n \\n4730/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 82/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income (loss) that could result from sudden \\nchanges that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the levels indicated in the table \\nand excludes the net cost of operating the hedging program.

The level and direction of the change in \\nreserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the beneﬁt ratio and the level of assessments associated with the variable \\nannuity.  These reserves are reported within future contract beneﬁts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the change reported in \\nbeneﬁts in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The change in the liability for a period is the beneﬁt ratio \\nmultiplied by the assessments recorded for the period less GDB claims paid in the period plus interest.  As experience or assumption \\nchanges result in a change in expected beneﬁt payments or assessments, the beneﬁt ratio is unlocked or, in other words, recalculated \\nusing the updated expected beneﬁt payments and assessments over the life of the contract since inception.  During the third quarter of \\neach year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models used in estimating these reserves and 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 83/324unlock assumptions similar to the DAC discussion above.

We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling reﬁnements that \\nresult in increases or decreases to the carrying values of these reserves.  See “Annual Assumption Review” below for more information.   \\n \\nWe utilize a delta hedging strategy for variable annuity products with a GDB feature, which uses futures and total return swaps on \\nequity market indices to hedge against movements in equity markets.  The hedging strategy is designed to hedge our exposure to \\nearnings volatility that results from equity market driven changes in the reserve for GDB contracts.  Because the GDB reserves are \\nbased upon projected long-term equity market return assumptions, and because the value of the hedging contracts will reﬂect current \\ncapital market conditions, the quarterly changes in values for the GDB reserves and the hedging contracts may not exactly offset each \\nother.  For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) – Variable \\nAnnuity Net Derivative Results” below. \\n \\nUL Products with Secondary Guarantees\\n \\nWe issue UL-type contracts where we provide a secondary guarantee to the contract holder.  The policy can remain in force, even if the \\nbase policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met.  The reserves related to UL \\nproducts with secondary guarantees are based on the application of a beneﬁt ratio the same as our GDB features, which are discussed \\nabove.  These secondary guarantees are reported within future contract beneﬁts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The level and \\ndirection of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the beneﬁt ratio and the level of assessments \\nassociated with the contracts.  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and \\nprojection models used in estimating these reserves and unlock assumptions similar to the DAC discussion above.  We may have \\nunlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our comprehensive \\nreview.  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling reﬁnements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values \\nof these reserves.  See “Annual Assumption Review” below for more information.\\n \\nLiability for Unpaid Claims\\n \\nFuture contract beneﬁts include reserves for long-term life and disability claims associated with our Group Protection segment.  These \\nreserves are based on assumptions as to interest, claim resolution rates and offsets for other insurance including social security.  Claim \\nresolution rate assumptions and social security offsets are based on our actual experience.  The interest rate assumption used for \\ndiscounting long-term claim reserves is an important part of the reserving process due to the long beneﬁt period for these claims.  The \\ninterest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults \\nand investment expenses, for assets supporting the liabilities.  Our long-term disability reserves are discounted using rates ranging from \\n2.5% to 5.0% and vary by year of claim incurral.  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the \\nassumptions and reserving models used in calculating these reserves.  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling \\nreﬁnements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of these reserves.  See “Annual Assumption Review” below for \\nmore information.        \\n \\nOther Contract Holder Funds\\n \\nOther contract holder funds includes account values on UL and VUL insurance and investment-type annuity products where account \\nvalues are equal to deposits plus interest credited less withdrawals, surrender charges, asset-based fees and contract administration \\ncharges, as well as amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our IUL and indexed \\nannuity products.  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection \\nmodels underlying our reserves and embedded derivatives.  We may have unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of \\ninformation that warrants updating assumptions outside of our comprehensive review.  See “Annual Assumption Review” below for \\nmore information.   \\n \\nOur indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect a ﬁxed interest rate return or a return where interest credited to the \\ncontracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500® Index or other indices.  The value of the variable portion of the contract \\nholder’s account balance varies with the performance of the underlying variable funds chosen by the contract holder.  Contract holders \\nmay elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal dates.  At the end of each indexed term, which can be \\nup to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing different participation rates, caps, spreads or \\nspeciﬁed rates, subject to contractual guarantees.  We purchase and sell index options that are highly correlated to the portfolio \\nallocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset \\nperiod.  The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the contract, \\nboth of which are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  \\nThe Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC require that we calculate fair \\nvalues of index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations in future reset periods.  These \\nfair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase or sell in the future, discounted back to the date of the \\nbalance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates.  Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included \\nas a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

For more \\ninformation on our comprehensive review, see Note 1.  Details underlying the effect to net income (loss) from our annual assumption \\nreview (in millions) were as follows:\\n \\n \\n  \\n          \\n          \\n For the Years Ended December 31, \\n 2022  2021  2020  \\nIncome (loss) from operations:          \\nLife Insurance $  (2,197)$  (26)$  (440)\\nAnnuities   217   (5)  (101)\\nGroup Protection   1   16   (3)\\nRetirement Plan Services   6   -   (3)\\nExcluded realized gain (loss)   (86)  6   58 \\nNet income (loss) $  (2,059)$  (9)$  (489)\\n \\nThe impacts of our annual assumption review were driven primarily by the following:\\n \\n2022\\n \\n\\x00For Life Insurance, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to policyholder behavior assumptions related to UL products \\nwith secondary guarantees in the amount of $1.8 billion, after-tax, as well as updates to mortality, morbidity and reinsurance \\nassumptions and other items. \\n\\x00For Annuities, favorable unlocking was driven by increases to interest rate assumptions, partially offset by unfavorable updates to \\nother items.\\n\\x00For Group Protection, the favorable impact was driven by updates to life waiver assumptions and increases to interest rate \\nassumptions, partially offset by unfavorable updates to long-term disability incidence and severity assumptions. \\n\\x00For Retirement Plan Services, favorable unlocking was driven by increases to interest rate assumptions and other items.\\n\\x00For excluded realized gain (loss), unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to policyholder behavior assumptions that \\nimpacted ceded reserves, partially offset by favorable updates to expense and capital market assumptions.\\n \\n2021\\n \\n\\x00For Life Insurance, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to policyholder behavior and interest rate assumptions, partially \\noffset by favorable updates to investment allocation assumptions.\\n\\x00For Annuities, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to policyholder behavior and interest rate assumptions, partially offset \\nby favorable updates to expense assumptions.\\n\\x00For Group Protection, the favorable impact was driven by updates to long-term disability termination rate assumptions, partially \\noffset by unfavorable updates to interest rate assumptions. \\n\\x00For excluded realized gain (loss), favorable unlocking was driven by updates to expense assumptions and other items, partially \\noffset by unfavorable updates to policyholder behavior assumptions.\\n \\nLong-Term New Money Investment Yield Sensitivity\\n \\nNew money rates have increased but underlying interest rate volatility remains high.  As a result, new money rates require careful \\nanalysis when forecasting the future direction of changes in rates.  If we change our view of future new money rates and lower our \\ncurrent long-term new money investment yield assumption, then, assuming that all other assumptions remain constant, we estimate the \\nimpact of lowering this assumption by 50 basis points would be approximately $(225)\\xa0million to income (loss) from operations due \\nprimarily to unlocking our DAC and VOBA assets.  This impact would be most pronounced in our Life Insurance segment.  The actual \\nimpact of a 50 basis point decline in the yield would be based upon a number of factors existing at the time of the assumption update, \\nand, therefore, the actual amount of the loss may differ from our current estimate.  In addition, lower investment margins may also \\nimpact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss \\nrecognition events on certain policyholder liabilities.  For more information on our interest rate risk, see “Part II – Item 7A. \\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5030/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 87/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\n \\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and \\nmore frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit \\nbelow its carrying value.  Intangibles that do not have indeﬁnite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  We perform a \\nquantitative goodwill impairment test where the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the \\nreporting unit.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is impaired and written down \\nto the reporting unit’s fair value.  The results of one test on one reporting unit cannot subsidize the results of another reporting unit.  For \\nthe purposes of the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill, our reporting units (Life Insurance, Annuities, Group Protection and \\nRetirement Plan Services) correspond with our reporting segments.\\n \\nThe fair values of our reporting units are comprised of the value of in-force (i.e., existing) business and the value of new business.  \\nSpeciﬁcally, new business is representative of cash ﬂows and proﬁtability associated with policies or contracts we expect to issue in the \\nfuture, reﬂecting our forecasts of future sales volume and product mix over a 10-year period.  To determine the values of in-force and \\nnew business, we use a discounted cash ﬂows technique that applies a discount rate reﬂecting the market expected, weighted-average \\nrate of return adjusted for the risk factors associated with operations to the projected future cash ﬂows for each reporting unit.\\n \\nWe apply signiﬁcant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units.  Factors that can inﬂuence the value of \\ngoodwill include the capital markets, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, consumer conﬁdence and any items that can \\ndirectly or indirectly affect new business future cash ﬂows.  Factors that could affect production levels and proﬁtability of new business \\ninclude mix of new business, pricing changes, customer acceptance of our products and distribution strength.  Spread compression and \\nrelated effects to proﬁtability caused by lower interest rates affect the valuation of in-force business more signiﬁcantly than the \\nvaluation of new business, as new business pricing assumptions reﬂect the current and anticipated future interest rate environment.  \\nEstimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future \\ndevelopments.  Examples of unfavorable changes to assumptions or factors that could result in future impairment include, but are not \\nlimited to, the following:\\n \\n\\x00Lower expectations for future sales levels or future sales proﬁtability;\\n\\x00Higher discount rates on new business assumptions;\\n\\x00Weakened expectations for the ability to execute future reserve ﬁnancing transactions for life insurance business over the long-term \\nor expectations for signiﬁcant increases in the associated costs;\\n\\x00Legislative, regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of \\nreserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements or \\nchanges to RBC requirements; and\\n\\x00Valuations of signiﬁcant mergers or acquisitions of companies or blocks of business that would provide relevant market-based \\ninputs for our impairment assessment that could support less favorable conclusions regarding the estimated fair value of our \\nreporting units.\\n \\nAs a result of the capital market environment during the third quarter of 2022, including (i) declining equity markets and (ii) the impact \\nof rising interest rates on our discount rate assumption, we accelerated our quantitative goodwill impairment test for our Life Insurance \\nreporting unit as we concluded that there were indicators of impairment.  Based on this quantitative test, which included updating our \\nbest estimate assumptions therein, we incurred an impairment during the third quarter of 2022 of the Life Insurance reporting unit \\ngoodwill of $634 million, which represented a write-off of the entire balance of goodwill for the reporting unit.  As of October 1, 2022, \\nwe performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test for the remaining reporting units, and, as of October 1, 2022, the fair \\nvalue was in excess of each such other reporting unit’s carrying value. \\n \\nRefer to Note 9 for goodwill and speciﬁcally identiﬁable intangible assets by segment.\\n \\nIncome Taxes \\n \\nManagement uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the \\ndeferred income tax liabilities and assets for items recognized differently in its ﬁnancial statements from amounts shown on its income \\ntax returns and the federal income tax expense.\\xa0 Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax laws and \\nregulations.\\xa0 Management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income \\ntax liabilities and assets.\\xa0 These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors \\nchange.  Legislative changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\\xa0modiﬁcations or new regulations, administrative \\nrulings,\\xa0or court decisions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate.\\n \\nIn August 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden.  The \\nInﬂation Reduction Act of 2022 established a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations whose average adjusted net \\nincome for any consecutive three-year period beginning after December 31, 2022, exceeds $1.0 billion.  The Inﬂation Reduction Act of \\n2022 also established a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded corporations.  Both provisions are effective for tax \\nyears beginning after December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax on our \\nbusiness, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 88/324 \\n \\n5130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 89/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\n \\nThe application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if \\nnecessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable.  Considerable judgment and the \\nuse of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation \\nallowance.  In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including:\\xa0 the nature and character of the \\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length \\nof time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax beneﬁt from expiring unused. \\n \\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had an approximate $2.2 billion deferred tax asset related to net unrealized losses on ﬁxed maturity AFS \\nsecurities.  In the assessment of the future realizability of this deferred tax asset, management considered tax planning strategy and \\nconcluded that unrealized losses were caused by factors other than credit loss, and we have the intent and ability to hold these securities \\nto recovery and collect all of the contractual cash ﬂows.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had a $278 million deferred tax \\nasset related to net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce our income taxes \\npayable in those future periods.  The net operating loss carryforwards do not expire and can be carried forward indeﬁnitely.  Although \\nrealization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss \\ndeferred tax asset, will be realized.

Although deposits do not \\nsigniﬁcantly affect current period income from operations, they can signiﬁcantly impact future income from operations.  The other \\ncomponent of net ﬂows relates to the retention of the business.\\xa0 An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values \\ncaused by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals.  These outﬂows as a percentage of average account values were 10%, \\n11% and 13% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  \\n \\nOur net ﬂows are negatively affected by the continued net outﬂows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our \\nNet Flows By Market table below as “Multi-Fund® and other”), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due \\nto the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs.  The proportion of these products to our total account \\nvalues was 17%, 18% and 19% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the \\ntime interest rates for these products reset.  We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through \\nportfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no signiﬁcant changes in net ﬂows into or out of our \\nﬁxed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

The portion of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities reported in \\noperating realized gain (loss) represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity and IUL contracts.\\n \\nOur GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both beneﬁt reserves and embedded derivative reserves.  We calculate the \\nvalue of the beneﬁt reserves and the embedded derivative reserves based on the speciﬁc characteristics of each GLB feature.  For our \\nGLBs that meet the deﬁnition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them \\nat fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the \\nportion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”).  These attributed fees \\nrepresent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation \\npremium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/proﬁt (the “risk/proﬁt margin”).\\n \\nWe also include the risk/proﬁt margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain (loss) and include the net \\nvaluation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss).  For our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services \\nsegments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in fee income. \\n \\nRealized Gain (Loss) Related to Financial Instruments and Reinsurance-Related Assets\\n \\nFor information on realized gain (loss) related to ﬁnancial instruments and reinsurance-related assets, see Note 15.\\n \\nGain (loss) on the mark-to-market on certain instruments, including those associated with our consolidated variable interest entities \\n(“VIEs”) represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable \\nannuity net derivative results), reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and trading securities.\\n \\nSee Note 3 for information about our consolidated VIEs.  \\n \\nWe also recognize the mark-to-market on certain mortgage loans on real estate for which we have elected the fair value option.  See \\nNote 20 for additional information.\\n \\nVariable Annuity Net Derivative Results\\n \\nOur variable annuity net derivative results include the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and \\nthe change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging \\ninstruments.  In addition, these results include the changes in reserves not accounted for at fair value and results from beneﬁt ratio \\nunlocking on our GDB and GLB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the beneﬁt ratio \\nunlocking on our GDB and GLB riders. \\n \\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded \\nderivative reserves.  The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded \\nderivative reserves.  Our variable annuity net derivative results can be volatile, especially when sudden and signiﬁcant changes in \\nequity markets and/or interest rates occur.  We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability.  The NPR \\nfactors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve.  Our methodology for calculating the \\nNPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected \\ncash ﬂows over the expected life of the embedded derivative.  Our cash ﬂows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract \\nholders and beneﬁts to be paid, and these cash ﬂows are different on a pre- and post-NPR basis.  We utilize a model based on our \\nholding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spread adjusted to reﬂect the credit quality of our insurance subsidiary as the issuing \\nentity.  Because the guaranteed beneﬁt liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the effect of \\nour insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance \\nliabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the speciﬁc \\nliability within our insurance subsidiaries. \\n \\n \\n \\n7330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 124/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nDetails underlying our variable annuity hedging program (dollars in millions) were as follows:\\n \\n  \\n                     \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  As of   As of   As of   As of   As of \\n December 31,September 30,June 30, March 31,December 31,\\n  2022   2022   2022   2022   2021  \\nVariable annuity hedge program assets (liabilities)  $  1,928  $  1,952  $  1,623  $  625  $  721 \\n                     \\nVariable annuity reserves – asset (liability):                     \\nEmbedded derivative reserves, pre-NPR (1) $  1,513  $  1,180  $  1,136  $  1,699  $  1,818 \\nNPR    40    145    164    46    17 \\nEmbedded derivative reserves    1,553    1,325    1,300    1,745    1,835 \\nInsurance beneﬁt reserves    (2,468)   (2,668)   (2,349)   (1,547)   (1,231)\\nTotal variable annuity reserves – asset (liability)  $  (915) $  (1,343) $  (1,049) $  198  $  604 \\n                     \\n10-year CDS spread   2.31%   2.10%   2.05%   1.44%   1.15% \\nNPR factor related to 10-year CDS spread   1.58%   1.47%   1.33%   0.99%   0.70% \\n \\n(1)Embedded derivative reserves in an asset (liability) position indicate we estimate the present value of future beneﬁts to be less \\n(greater) than the present value of future net valuation premiums.\\n \\nThe following shows the hypothetical effect (in millions) to net income (loss) for changes in the NPR factor along all points on the \\nspread curve as of December\\xa031, 2022:  \\n \\n \\n                     \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n Hypothetical                \\n  Effect                 \\nNPR factor:                     \\nDown 158 basis points to zero  $  (180)                \\nUp 20 basis points    9                 \\n \\nSee “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Beneﬁts – GLB” above for additional information about our \\nguaranteed beneﬁts.\\n \\nIndexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option\\n \\nThe liability for the forward-starting option reﬂects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index options \\nwe may purchase or sell in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed \\nannuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the \\nFASB ASC.

This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while \\nstill meeting our income objectives.  This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based \\nupon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  For a discussion of our risk \\nmanagement process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\\n \\nInvestment Portfolio Composition and Diversiﬁcation\\n \\nFundamental to our investment policy is diversiﬁcation across asset classes.  Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested \\ncash, is composed of ﬁxed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and \\nother long-term investments.  We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics \\nthat take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.  \\n \\nWe have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature \\nof our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 126/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nFixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios\\n \\nFixed maturity securities consist of portfolios classiﬁed as AFS and trading.

Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited \\nto AOCI.  For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based \\nupon an assumed emergence of gross proﬁts on certain insurance business.

However, securities designated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed \\nbelow investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities \\n(“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting.

We believe the unrealized loss position as of December\\xa031, \\n2022, did not require an impairment recognized in earnings as:  (i) we did not intend to sell these ﬁxed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is \\nnot more likely than not that we will be required to sell the ﬁxed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; \\nand (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss.  This conclusion is \\nconsistent with our asset-liability management process.  Management considered the following as part of the evaluation:\\n \\n\\x00The current economic environment and market conditions;\\n\\x00Our business strategy and current business plans;\\n\\x00The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate \\nrisk;\\n\\x00Our analysis of data from ﬁnancial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our \\nhedging and overall risk management strategies;\\n\\x00The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments \\nand expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\\n\\x00The capital risk limits approved by management; and\\n\\x00Our current ﬁnancial condition and liquidity demands.\\n \\nWe recognized $(15) million and $(11) million of credit loss beneﬁt (expense) on our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  In order to determine the amount of credit loss, we calculated the recovery value by \\nperforming a discounted cash ﬂow analysis based on the current cash ﬂows and future cash ﬂows we expect to recover.  To determine \\nthe recoverability, we considered the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the \\nfollowing:\\n \\n\\x00Historical and implied volatility of the security;\\n\\x00The extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; \\n\\x00Adverse conditions speciﬁcally related to the security or to speciﬁc conditions in an industry or geographic area; \\n\\x00Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and\\n\\x00Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. \\n \\nFor information on credit loss impairment on ﬁxed maturity AFS securities, see Notes 1, 4 and 15.\\n \\nAs reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $143.1\\xa0billion of liabilities for future obligations under insurance policies and\\ncontracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which exceeded investments and cash and invested cash, which totaled \\n$135.1\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2022.  If it were necessary to liquidate ﬁxed maturity AFS securities prior to maturity or call to meet \\ncash ﬂow needs, we would ﬁrst look to those ﬁxed maturity AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair \\nvalue of $16.6\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2022, rather than selling ﬁxed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position.  The \\namount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, \\nsuch as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash ﬂows from new and \\nexisting business.  For additional discussion, see “Fixed Maturity AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in \\nNote 1 and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.\\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $19.0\\xa0billion and $20.7\\xa0billion, \\nrespectively, representing 14% and 13% of total investments, respectively.\\n \\nTrading Securities\\n \\nTrading securities, which in certain cases support reinsurance funds withheld and our modiﬁed coinsurance agreements, are carried at \\nfair value and changes in fair value are recorded in net income as they occur.  Investment results for these certain portfolios, including \\ngains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements.  \\nOffsetting these amounts in certain cases are corresponding changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with \\nthe underlying reinsurance arrangement.  See Notes 1 and 8 for more information regarding modiﬁed coinsurance.\\n \\nMortgage-Backed Securities (Included in Fixed Maturity AFS and Trading Securities)\\n \\nOur ﬁxed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).  These securities are subject to risks associated with \\nvariable prepayments.  This may result in differences between the actual cash ﬂow and maturity of these securities than that expected at \\nthe time of purchase.  Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than \\nexpected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss.  Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than \\nexpected will generate an increase in yield or a gain.  In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the \\nbook yields earned on the securities.  Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite effect.  The degree to which a \\nsecurity is susceptible to either gains or losses is inﬂuenced by:  the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative \\nsensitivity of the underlying mortgages 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 132/324 \\n \\n7930/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 133/324Table of Contents\\n \\nbacking the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall \\nsecuritization structure.  \\n \\nWe limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of \\nsecurities with a cost that signiﬁcantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities with improving collateral performance, and by primarily \\ninvesting in securities that are current pay and senior priority in their trust structure.  A signiﬁcant amount of assets in our MBS \\nportfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, supported in the securitization structure by junior securities \\nor purchased at discounted prices signiﬁcantly lower than their expected recovery value, enabling the assets to achieve high investment \\ngrade status.  \\n \\nOur exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other ﬁnancial institutions that may be affected by \\nsubprime lending and direct investments in ABS and RMBS.  Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are \\nbacked by residential mortgages.  These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of \\ncreditworthiness:  prime; Alt-A; and subprime.  Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with \\nexcellent credit proﬁles.  Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit proﬁles but \\nlack documentation to substantiate income.  Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit \\nproﬁles.\\n \\nDelinquency and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans have been showing positive trends, and, as long as the \\nunemployment rate remains stable to improving, we expect these trends to continue.  We continue to expect to receive payments in \\naccordance with contractual terms for a signiﬁcant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral \\nof the securities that we own.  The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least \\nsenior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the ﬁrst loss.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, our ABS home \\nequity and RMBS had a market value of $2.3\\xa0billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and a net unrealized gain (loss) of $(195)\\xa0million \\nand $245 million, respectively.\\n \\n \\n \\n8030/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 134/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe market value of ﬁxed maturity AFS and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $191\\xa0million and represented less than \\n1% of our total investment portfolio as of December\\xa031, 2022.

The proﬁtability of our ﬁxed annuity and life insurance products is \\naffected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the \\ninterest credited to the contract holder on our average ﬁxed account values, including the ﬁxed portion of variable.  Net investment \\nincome and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, \\nalternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments.  These items can vary signiﬁcantly from \\nperiod to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.\\n \\nCommercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums\\n \\nPrepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity.  A \\nprepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments \\nuntil maturity.  These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment. \\n \\nREINSURANCE\\n \\nOur insurance companies cede insurance to other companies.  The portion of our life insurance risks exceeding each of our insurance \\ncompanies’ retention limit is reinsured with other insurers.  We seek life and annuity reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure to \\nmortality losses and/or to enhance our capital and risk management.  We acquire other reinsurance as applicable with retentions and \\nlimits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.  The consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in “Item 8. \\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data” reﬂect insurance premiums, insurance fees, beneﬁts and DAC amortization net of \\ninsurance ceded.  Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable \\nreinsurance agreements.  We utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge \\nprogram for variable annuity guarantees.  With regard to risk retention from a consolidated basis, these inter-company agreements do \\nnot have an effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.  For information regarding reserve ﬁnancing and LOC expenses from inter-\\ncompany reinsurance agreements, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Material Cash Outﬂows” below.\\n \\nWe focus on obtaining reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers.  We have established standards and criteria for our use and \\nselection of reinsurers.  In order for a new reinsurer to participate in our current program, we generally require the reinsurer to have an \\nAM Best rating of A+ or greater or an S&P rating of AA- or better and a speciﬁed RBC percentage (or similar capital ratio measure).  If \\nthe reinsurer does not have these ratings, we may require them to post collateral as described below; however, we may waive the \\ncollateral requirements based on the facts and circumstances.  In addition, we may require collateral from a reinsurer to mitigate \\ncredit/collectability risk.  Typically, in such cases, the reinsurer must either maintain minimum speciﬁed ratings and RBC ratios or \\nestablish the speciﬁed quality and quantity of collateral.  Similarly, we have also required collateral in connection with books of \\nbusiness sold pursuant to indemnity reinsurance agreements.\\n \\nReinsurers, including afﬁliated reinsurers, that are not licensed, accredited or authorized in the state of domicile of the reinsured \\n(“ceding company”), i.e., unauthorized reinsurers, are required to post statutorily prescribed forms of collateral for the ceding company \\nto receive reinsurance credit.  The three primary forms of collateral are:  (i) qualifying assets held in a reserve credit trust; (ii) \\nirrevocable, unconditional, evergreen LOCs issued by a qualiﬁed U.S. ﬁnancial institution; and (iii) assets held by the ceding company \\nin a segregated funds withheld account.  Collateral must be maintained in accordance with the rules of the ceding company’s state of \\ndomicile and must be readily accessible by the ceding company to cover claims under the reinsurance agreement.  Accordingly, our \\ninsurance subsidiaries require unauthorized reinsurers to post acceptable forms of collateral to support their reinsurance obligations to \\nus.  \\n \\nAs a result of our modiﬁed coinsurance agreement with Athene to reinsure ﬁxed annuity products, we reported a $3.8\\xa0billion deposit \\nasset within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.  For additional information, see Note 8.    \\n \\nOur amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, 83%, \\nor $16.6\\xa0billion, of our total reinsurance recoverable was secured by collateral for our beneﬁt.  Of this amount, $16.4\\xa0billion was held \\nby reinsurers in reserve credit trusts (such reserve credit trusts are held by non-afﬁliated reinsurers; therefore, they are not reﬂected on 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 145/324the Consolidated Balance Sheets), $130 million was held in our funds withheld portfolios and $93\\xa0million was secured by LOCs for \\nwhich we are the beneﬁciary, an off-balance sheet arrangement.

The excess funds withheld represent funds above the \\nreinsurance recoverable from our reinsurers.\\n \\nWe regularly evaluate the ﬁnancial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration risk with our largest reinsurers.  We monitor \\nall of our existing reinsurers’ ﬁnancial strength ratings on a monthly basis.  We also monitor our reinsurers’ ﬁnancial health, trends and \\ncommitment to the reinsurance business, statutory surplus, RBC levels, statutory earnings and ﬂuctuations, current claims payment \\naging and our reinsurers’ own reinsurers.  In addition, we present at least annually information regarding our reinsurance exposures to \\nthe Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.  For more discussion of our counterparty risk with our reinsurers, see “Part I – Item \\n1A. Risk Factors – Operational Matters – We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which \\ncould materially affect our results of operations.”\\n \\nUnder certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, two of our insurance subsidiaries, LNL and Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New \\nYork (“LLANY”), provide 100% indemnity reinsurance for the business assumed; however, the third-party insurer, or the “cedent,” \\nremains primarily liable on the underlying insurance business.  These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our subsidiary, \\nas the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer ﬁnancial strength ratings and capital ratios.  If these ratings or capital ratios are not maintained, \\ndepending upon the reinsurance agreement, the cedent may recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide LOCs \\nat least equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  Under the LNL reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $2.7\\xa0billion of \\nstatutory reserves as of December\\xa031, 2022.  LNL must maintain an AM Best ﬁnancial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P ﬁnancial \\nstrength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s ﬁnancial strength rating of at least Baa3.  This arrangement may require LNL to place \\nassets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  Under LLANY’s largest indemnity reinsurance arrangement, we held \\napproximately $1.1\\xa0billion of statutory reserves as of December\\xa031, 2022.  LLANY must maintain an AM Best ﬁnancial strength rating \\nof at least B+, an S&P ﬁnancial strength rating of at least BB+ and a Moody’s ﬁnancial strength rating of at least Ba1, as well as \\nmaintain an RBC ratio of at least 160% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 100%, or the cedent may recapture the business.  Under \\ntwo other LLANY arrangements, by which we established $612 million of statutory reserves as of December\\xa031, 2022, LLANY must \\nmaintain an AM Best ﬁnancial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P ﬁnancial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s ﬁnancial \\nstrength rating of at least Baa3.  One of these arrangements also requires LLANY to maintain an RBC ratio of at least 185% or an S&P \\ncapital adequacy ratio of 115%.  Each of these arrangements may require LLANY to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory \\nreserves.  See “Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” for a description of our ﬁnancial strength ratings.\\n \\nFor more information about reinsurance, see Notes 8 and 13 and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Holding Company Sources and \\nUses of Liquidity and Capital –Subsidiaries’ Capital” below. \\n \\nFor factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” \\nand “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.\\n \\n \\n  \\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n \\nOverview\\n \\nLiquidity\\n \\nLiquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations to meet cash requirements with a \\nprudent margin of safety.  Our ability to generate and maintain sufﬁcient liquidity depends on the proﬁtability of our businesses, general \\neconomic conditions and access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity and capital as described below.\\n \\nWhen considering our liquidity, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the \\nholding company, LNC.  As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of \\nits insurance subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance or repay funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which \\nmay be affected by factors inﬂuencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance.  Based on the sources of \\nliquidity available to us as discussed below, we currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs.  \\n \\nCapital\\n \\nCapital refers to our long-term ﬁnancial resources to support the operations of our businesses, to fund long-term growth strategies and \\nto support our operations during adverse conditions.  Our ability to generate and maintain sufﬁcient capital depends on the proﬁtability \\nof our businesses, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity and capital as described \\nbelow.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may materially affect our business operations and results \\nof operations.  These poor market conditions may reduce our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC.\\n \\nReductions to our subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC may cause them to retain more capital, which may pressure their ability to \\npay dividends to LNC, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital.  As a result of the charge taken in \\nconnection with the annual assumption review in the third quarter of 2022, we expect an approximate $300 million statutory capital \\nimpact in the \\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 147/3248830/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 148/324Table of Contents\\n \\nfourth quarter of 2022 that will reduce our RBC ratio by approximately 12 points.  We believe we have adequate capital to operate our \\nbusiness as we replenish statutory capital back to our targeted levels.  For more information, see “Subsidiaries’ Capital” below.\\n \\nFor factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section and that could affect our expectations \\nfor liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.\\n \\nConsolidated Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\\n \\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital are insurance premiums and fees, investment income, maturities and sales of investments, \\nissuance of debt or other types of securities and contract holder deposits.  We also have access to alternative sources of liquidity as \\ndiscussed below.  Our primary uses are to pay policy claims and beneﬁts, to fund commissions and other general operating expenses, to \\npurchase investments, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our common and preferred stockholders, to \\nrepurchase our common stock and to repay debt.  Our operating activities provided (used) cash of $4.0 billion, $151\\xa0million and $534 \\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n \\nHolding Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\\n \\nThe primary sources of liquidity and capital at the holding company level are dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, \\naugmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public ﬁnancing \\nunder an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, \\npreferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.  These sources support \\nthe general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, common stock repurchases, \\ninterest and debt service, funding of callable securities, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.  \\n \\nDetails underlying the primary sources of the holding company’s liquidity (in millions) were as follows:\\n \\n  \\n          \\n          \\n For the Years Ended December 31, \\n 2022  2021  2020  \\nDividends from Subsidiaries          \\nLNL $  645 $  1,910 $  660 \\nFirst Penn-Paciﬁc Life Insurance Company   22   45   - \\nLincoln Investment Management Company   38   20   25 \\nLincoln National Management Corporation   7   10   5 \\nLincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) \\nLimited   85   75   150 \\nTotal dividends from subsidiaries $  797 $  2,060 $  840 \\n          \\nInterest from Subsidiaries          \\nInterest on inter-company notes $  118 $  111 $  123 \\n \\nSee Note 19 for information on the increase in dividends from LNL in 2021.  The table above focuses on signiﬁcant and recurring cash \\nﬂow items and excludes the effects of certain ﬁnancing activities, including the periodic issuance and retirement of debt, issuance of \\npreferred stock, cash ﬂows related to our inter-company cash management program and certain investing activities, including capital \\ncontributions to subsidiaries.  These activities are discussed below.  Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing \\nagreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash ﬂows at the holding company.  Also excluded from \\nthis analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company and employee stock \\nexercise activity related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans.  See “Part IV – Item 15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules \\n– Schedule II – Condensed Financial Information of Registrant” for the holding company cash ﬂow statement.\\n \\nRestrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends\\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of \\ndividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary \\ninsurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the \\n“Commissioner”) only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, \\nalong with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The current \\nstatutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on ﬁle with the \\nCommissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory \\nunassigned surplus.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  \\nLNL’s subsidiary LLANY, a New York-domiciled insurance company, is bound by similar restrictions under New York law, with the \\napplicable statutory limitation on dividends equal to the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the end of the immediately \\npreceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.\\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 149/324 \\n8930/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 150/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nIndiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in \\nrelation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its ﬁnancial needs, and permits the Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a \\ndividend that violates these standards.  In the event the Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is \\ninadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from \\nanother subsidiary for the beneﬁt of that insurance subsidiary.\\n \\nWe expect our direct domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends to LNC of approximately $1.7 billion in 2023 without prior \\napproval from the respective state commissioners.  The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is \\nconstrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and \\nfor future investment in our businesses.  See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital \\nand surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer ﬁnancial strength ratings.” \\n \\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities.  These investments are subject to general credit, \\nliquidity, market and interest rate risks.  An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its \\nsubsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional ﬁnancing will be available to us on \\nfavorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment.  In addition, further impairment could reduce our statutory surplus, leading \\nto lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.  See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk \\nFactors – Liquidity and Capital Position – Adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, \\naccess to capital and cost of capital.”\\n \\nSubsidiaries’ Capital \\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries must maintain certain regulatory capital levels.  We utilize the RBC ratio as a primary measure of the capital \\nadequacy of our insurance subsidiaries.  The RBC ratio is an important factor in the determination of the credit and ﬁnancial strength \\nratings of LNC and its subsidiaries, as a reduction in our insurance subsidiaries’ surplus will affect their RBC ratios and dividend-\\npaying capacity.  For a discussion of the actions management is taking to rebuild statutory capital, see “Introduction – Executive \\nSummary – Signiﬁcant Operational Matters – Rebuilding Risk-Based Capital.”  For additional information on RBC ratios, see “Part I – \\nItem 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation – Risk-Based Capital.”\\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries’ regulatory capital levels are affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each \\napplicable insurance regulator.  Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated \\npursuant to Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII (“AG38”).  Our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by AG38 \\nby reinsuring the business to reinsurance captives.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for \\nﬁnancing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efﬁcient manner and free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for \\nany number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company.  We use long-dated LOCs and debt ﬁnancing as well as \\nother ﬁnancing strategies to ﬁnance those reserves.  Included in the LOCs issued as of December\\xa031, 2022, was $1.8\\xa0billion of long-\\ndated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements for UL products containing secondary guarantees.  For \\ninformation on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 12.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have also \\nissued long-term notes of $3.9\\xa0billion to ﬁnance a portion of the excess reserves as of December\\xa031, 2022; of this amount, $3.1\\xa0billion \\ninvolve exposure to VIEs.  For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see \\nNote 3.  We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875\\xa0million to execute long-term structured solutions primarily \\nsupporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees.  LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital \\neffect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  \\n \\nStatutory reserves established for variable annuity guaranteed beneﬁt riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and interest \\nrates and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance \\narrangements.  As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given \\nreporting period.  Our insurance subsidiaries’ cede a portion of the guaranteed beneﬁt riders to Lincoln National Reinsurance Company \\n(Barbados) Limited (“LNBAR”) through inter-company reinsurance arrangements.  Our variable annuity hedge program in LNBAR \\nseeks to hedge our exposure to selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the capital markets associated with \\nthe variable annuity guarantees.  Market conditions greatly inﬂuence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of \\nreserves and derivative instruments hedging these reserves.  The capital markets environment in 2022 led to market volatility and \\nincreased hedge breakage that has impacted capital in LNBAR.\\xa0 As a result, we did not take dividends out of LNBAR after the ﬁrst \\nquarter of 2022.  In December 2022, LNC issued a $500 million long-term note to a non-afﬁliated variable interest entity in exchange \\nfor a corporate bond AFS security of like principal and duration.  LNC contributed the security to LNBAR to address asset value \\nvolatility based on market conditions.  There are no impacts to the LNC Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the set-off right \\nprovided in the transaction.  For more information, see Note 3.\\n  \\nIn September 2022, we announced enhancements to our variable annuity hedge program that continues to focus on generating sufﬁcient \\nassets to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital.  The revised variable \\nannuity hedge program, effective January 1, 2023, aligns with our increased strategic focus on maximizing the economic value as \\nmeasured by distributable earnings, which is achieved by managing risks to capital generation due to market volatility.  For additional \\ninformation on our variable annuity hedge program, see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Signiﬁcant Operational Matters – \\nVariable Annuity Hedge 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 151/324 \\n \\n9030/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 152/324Table of Contents\\n \\nProgram.”  For risks related to our variable annuity hedge program, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Our \\nhedging strategies may not be fully effective to offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees on certain of our products, \\nwhich could result in volatility in our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition under GAAP and in the capital levels of our \\ninsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.”  \\n \\nWe also use long-dated LOCs or other capital market solutions to reduce the potential strain caused by temporary mismatches between \\nmovements in the statutory reserves and derivative instruments for variable annuity guaranteed beneﬁt riders reinsured to LNBAR.  \\nIncluded in the LOCs issued as of December 31, 2022, was $1.6 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company \\nreinsurance arrangements for variable annuity guaranteed beneﬁt riders.  For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in \\nNote 12.  \\n \\nChanges in equity markets may also affect the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries.  We may decide to reallocate available \\ncapital among our insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance subsidiaries, which would result in different RBC ratios for \\nour insurance subsidiaries.  In addition, changes in the equity markets can affect the value of our variable annuity and variable universal \\nlife insurance separate accounts.  When the market value of our separate account assets increases, the statutory surplus within our \\ninsurance subsidiaries also increases.  Contrarily, when the market value of our separate account assets decreases, the statutory surplus \\nwithin our insurance subsidiaries may also decrease, which will affect RBC ratios, and in the case of our separate account assets \\nbecoming less than the related product liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the difference.\\n \\nWe\\xa0continue to\\xa0analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance \\narrangements, and\\xa0our hedging strategies relative to managing the\\xa0effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, \\nstatutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.\\xa0 \\n \\nDebt\\n \\nAlthough our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash ﬂow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically LNC may \\nissue debt to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of its debt.  \\n \\nDetails underlying our debt activities (in millions) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022, were as follows:\\n \\n \\n                      \\n                      \\n       Maturities, Change        \\n       Repayments in Fair        \\n Beginning     and  Value  Other  Ending\\n Balance Issuance Reﬁnancing Hedges Changes (1) Balance\\nShort-Term Debt                      \\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt (2) $  300 $  -  $  (300) $  -  $  500  $  500\\n                      \\nLong-Term Debt                      \\nSenior notes $  4,867 $  300  $  -  $  (156) $  (514) $  4,497\\nTerm loans   250   -    -    -    -    250\\nSubordinated notes (3)  995   -    -    -    -    995\\nCapital securities (3)  213   -    -    -    -    213\\nTotal long-term debt $  6,325 $  300  $  -  $  (156) $  (514) $  5,955\\n \\n(1)Includes the non-cash reclassiﬁcation of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion (amortization) of \\ndiscounts and premiums, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of adjustments from discontinued hedges, as \\napplicable.\\n(2)As of December 31, 2022, consisted of $500 million principal amount of our 4.00% Senior Notes due September 1, 2023.\\n(3)To hedge the variability in rates, we purchased interest rate swaps to lock in a ﬁxed rate of approximately 5% over the remaining \\nterms of the subordinated notes and capital securities.  \\n \\nOn March 1, 2022, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.40% Senior Notes due \\n2032.

We intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund part of the \\nrepayment upon maturity of our 4.00% Senior Notes due September 1, 2023.  For additional information, see “Introduction – Executive \\nSummary – Signiﬁcant Operational Matters – Rebuild Risk-Based Capital Ratio” above and Note 14.\\n \\nCapital Contributions to Subsidiaries\\n \\nLNC made capital contributions to subsidiaries of $925 million, $65 million and $518 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, \\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n \\nReturn of Capital to Common Stockholders \\n \\nOne of our primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock \\nrepurchases.  In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, \\ncapital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility.  The amount and timing of share repurchases \\ndepends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of dividends from our subsidiaries and an evaluation of the \\ncosts and beneﬁts associated with alternative uses of capital.  We paused our common stock repurchases under our buyback program \\nbeginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, and we expect the pause to continue through the end of 2023.  For additional information \\nregarding share repurchases, see “Item 5.

The cash management program is essentially a series \\nof demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries \\nto access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, the holding company had a net \\noutstanding receivable (payable) of $62\\xa0million from (to) certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of \\namounts placed (borrowed) by the holding company and subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account.  Any change in \\nholding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and \\ninvested cash.  Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions.  \\nFor our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiary, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted \\nassets as of its most recent year end.  For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its \\nadmitted assets as of its most recent year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.\\n \\nFacility Agreement for Senior Notes Issuance\\n \\nLNC entered into a facility agreement in 2020 with a Delaware trust that gives LNC the right over a 10-year period to issue, from time \\nto time, up to $500\\xa0million of 2.330% senior notes to the trust in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities held \\nby the trust.  By agreeing to purchase the 2.330% senior notes in exchange for U.S. Treasury securities upon exercise of the issuance \\nright, the trust will provide a source of liquid assets for the Company.  The issuance right will be exercised automatically in full upon \\nour failure to make certain payments to the trust, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or upon certain bankruptcy events \\ninvolving LNC.  We are also required to exercise the issuance right in full if our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI) \\nfalls below a minimum threshold (which was $2.75 billion as of December 31, 2022, and is subject to adjustment from time to time in \\ncertain cases) and upon certain other events described in the facility agreement.

In addition, our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries had access \\nto $2.25\\xa0billion through committed repurchase agreements, of which $25\\xa0million was utilized as of December\\xa031, 2022.  The cash \\nreceived in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash and invested cash or ﬁxed maturity \\nAFS securities.  For additional information, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.\\n \\nCollateral on Derivative Contracts\\n \\nOur cash ﬂows associated with collateral received from counterparties (when we are in a net collateral payable position) and posted \\nwith counterparties (when we are in a net collateral receivable position) change as the market value of the underlying derivative \\ncontract changes.  The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the \\nexposures hedged.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, we were in a net collateral payable position of $3.1\\xa0billion compared to $4.9\\xa0billion as of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2021.  In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a \\ncounterparty.  If we do not have sufﬁcient high-quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have committed \\nliquidity sources through facilities that can provide up to $1.25\\xa0billion of additional liquidity to help meet collateral needs.  Access to \\nsuch facilities is contingent upon interest rates having achieved certain threshold levels.  In addition to these facilities, we have the \\nfacility agreement for senior notes issuance, the FHLB facilities and the repurchase agreements discussed above as well as the ﬁve-year \\nrevolving credit facility discussed in Note 12 to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting.

Securities are rated at the time of issuance so \\nactual ratings may differ from the indicative ratings.  There may be other rating agencies that also provide credit ratings, which we do \\nnot disclose in our reports.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  All credit ratings are on outlook \\nnegative except for the ratings assigned by S&P, which are on outlook stable.\\n \\nAs of February\\xa013, 2023, our indicative long-term credit ratings as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our long-term \\ncredit are indicated in the following table.\\n \\n        \\nAM Best  Fitch  Moody's  S&P  \\n“aaa to c” “AAA to D” “Aaa to C” “AAA to D”  \\nbbb+  BBB+  Baa1  BBB+  \\n(8th of 22) (8th of 21) (8th of 21) (8th of 22)  \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 158/324 \\n \\n9430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 159/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nAs of February\\xa013, 2023, our indicative short-term credit ratings as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our short-term \\ncredit are indicated in the following table.\\n \\n        \\nAM Best  Fitch  Moody's  S&P  \\n“AMB-1+ to \\nAMB-4”  “F1 to D”  “P-1 to NP” “A-1+ to D”  \\nAMB-2  F2  P-2  A-2  \\n(3rd of 6)  (3rd of 8)  (2nd of 4) (3rd of 7)  \\n \\nAll of our credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be \\ngiven that we can maintain these ratings.  A downgrade of our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms \\nand conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.  In addition, a downgrade of these ratings \\ncould make it more difﬁcult to raise capital to reﬁnance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance \\nsubsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current ﬁnancial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries described in “Part I – Item 1. \\nBusiness – Financial Strength Ratings.”\\n \\nIf our current ﬁnancial strength ratings or credit ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be \\ntriggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity.  For the majority of our derivative counterparties, there is a termination event \\nwith respect to LNC if its long-term senior debt ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s); or with respect to LNL if its ﬁnancial \\nstrength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s).  In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be \\nnegatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products.  \\n \\nSee “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our ﬁnancial strength or credit ratings could limit our \\nability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” for \\nmore information.\\n \\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \\n \\nWe analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of ﬁnancial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-\\nliability management process that considers diversiﬁcation.  By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire \\nenterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value.  We have exposures to several \\nmarket risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk.  The \\nexposures of ﬁnancial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where \\nmost of the investments support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products.  As an important element of our integrated \\nasset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield \\ncurve, currency movements and volatility.\\xa0 In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of \\nsigniﬁcant increases in interest rates on our earnings.  Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance \\nproducts and in our debt structure and derivatives positions.  Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and \\nsustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values.  These market risks are discussed in detail in \\nthe following pages and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the accompanying Notes \\npresented in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.”\\n \\nInterest Rate Risk \\xa0\\n \\nInterest rate risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest \\nrates.  We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from our ﬁxed maturity securities and interest sensitive liabilities.\\n \\nWith respect to accumulation and investment-oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and proﬁtable spread, or margin, between \\ninvestment income we earn on our investments and interest credited to account values of our contract holders.  If we have adverse \\nexperience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced.  The combination of a probable range of \\ninterest rate changes over the next 12 months, asset-liability management strategies, ﬂexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels \\nand protection afforded by policy surrender charges all work together to mitigate this risk.  The interest rate scenarios of concern are \\nthose in which there is a substantial, relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid \\nincrease in interest rates. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 160/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nSigniﬁcant Interest Rate Exposures\\n \\nThe following provides a general measure of our signiﬁcant interest rate risk;

Moreover, borrowers may prepay ﬁxed-income securities, commercial mortgages and MBS in our general \\naccounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk.  Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our \\nﬁxed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or \\ncrediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.  \\n \\nProlonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals.  However, we have recognized this risk and have been \\nproactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk \\nof unfavorable consequences in this type of environment.

We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling \\ninterest rates by simulating asset and liability cash ﬂows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios.  We seek to manage these exposures \\nby maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.\\n \\nInterest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Rising Rates\\n \\nFor both universal life insurance and annuities, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders.  \\nThe portfolios supporting these products have ﬁxed-rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from 1 to 10 years or more.  \\nAccordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields.  As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing \\nMBS prepayments.  The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates.  If we \\nset renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors’ new money rates \\nmay be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders.  If \\nwe credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow.  We devote extensive effort to evaluating these \\nrisks by simulating asset and liability cash ﬂows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios.  Such analysis has led to adjustments in the \\ntarget maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by entering into interest rate cap corridor agreements.  With these \\ninstruments in place, the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances.  See “Part I – \\nItem 1A.

Our revenues, assets \\nand liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives.  Due to the use of our RTM process and our \\nhedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term ﬂuctuations in the equity markets should not have a signiﬁcant effect on our \\nquarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  However, earnings are affected by equity market \\nmovements on account values and the related fees we earn on those assets.  Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – \\nDAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Reversion to the Mean” in the MD&A for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our \\nRTM.\\n \\nFee Income \\n \\nThe fees earned from variable life insurance and variable annuities products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values.  \\nThese fees are generally a ﬁxed percentage of the market value of account values.  In a severe equity market decline, fee income could \\nbe reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions.  Such withdrawals and \\nredemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our ﬁxed-income accounts and the transfer of \\nfunds to us from our competitors’ customers.\\n  \\nEquity Assets\\n \\nWhile we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core ﬁxed-income \\ninvestments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our ﬁxed-income \\ninvestments.  These investments, however, add diversiﬁcation beneﬁts to our ﬁxed-income investments.  \\n \\nDerivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk\\n \\nWe enter into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market risk.  Such derivatives include over-the-counter equity \\noptions, total return swaps, variance swaps, and equity futures.

We are exposed to credit risk primarily by our investments in \\ncorporate bonds and mortgage loans on real estate and through our use of derivatives.\\n \\nInvestments\\n \\nThe majority of our credit risk is concentrated in investment holdings.  Our portfolio of investments was $131.8\\xa0billion and \\n$153.6\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Of this total, $81.3\\xa0billion and $100.9\\xa0billion consisted of corporate \\nbonds and $18.3\\xa0billion and $18.0\\xa0billion consisted of mortgage loans on real estate as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  \\nWe manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting \\nstandards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, \\nregion and property type.  For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its afﬁliates, our exposures from all transactions are \\naggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality.  Additional diversiﬁcation limits, such as limits per industry, \\nare also applied.  We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be \\nsigniﬁcantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing. \\n \\nDerivatives \\n\\xa0\\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk through our various derivative contracts.  We depend on the ability of derivative product \\ndealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements.  In order to \\nminimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in \\naccordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor.  We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated \\nunder these derivative contracts to those with an “A” credit rating or above.  See Note 5 for additional information on managing the \\ncredit risk of our counterparties.  \\n \\nWe are also exposed to credit risk through the use of certain derivatives.  We buy CDSs to minimize our exposure to credit-related \\nevents with respect to a single entity or referenced index.  We also sell CDSs to offer credit protection to our contract holders and \\ninvestors with respect to a single entity or referenced index.  See Note 5 for additional information on our use of credit derivatives.\\n \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \\n\\xa0\\nForeign Currency Denominated Investments\\n \\nForeign currency exchange risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.  We have foreign \\ncurrency exchange risk in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of ﬁxed maturity securities.  The \\ncurrency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the foreign denominated security.  \\n \\nWe invest in ﬁxed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies for incremental return and risk diversiﬁcation relative to U.S. \\ndollar-denominated securities.  We use foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in ﬁxed \\nmaturity securities denominated in foreign currencies.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, our unhedged positions consisted of zero \\nand $4\\xa0million, respectively, of principal in U.S. dollar equivalents of Canadian-denominated investments with maturity dates up to \\n2025 and an average interest rate of 2%.  As of the same dates, our modiﬁed coinsurance portfolios were partially hedged and consisted \\nof $164\\xa0million and $181\\xa0million, respectively, of principal in U.S. dollar equivalents of foreign denominated investments with \\nmaturity dates up to 2063 and an average interest rate of 4%.  Investment results for our modiﬁed coinsurance agreements are passed \\ndirectly to the reinsurers.  See “Interest Rate Risk – Signiﬁcant Interest Rate Exposures” above for our notional amounts in U.S. dollar \\nequivalents (in millions) by year of maturity for our foreign currency swaps.\\n \\nSee Note 5 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 169/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements present \\nfairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of the Company at December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations \\nand its cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended December\\xa031, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted \\naccounting principles.\\n \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \\nthe Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our \\nreport dated February\\xa016, 2023 expressed an unqualiﬁed opinion thereon.\\n \\nBasis for Opinion\\n \\nThese ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \\nCompany’s ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of \\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our \\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or \\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding \\nthe amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \\nsigniﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that \\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n \\nCritical Audit Matters\\n \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the ﬁnancial statements that were \\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to \\nthe ﬁnancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical \\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or \\ndisclosures to which they relate.\\n \\n \\n \\n10530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 173/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Deferred Acquisition Costs Asset and Future Contract Beneﬁts Liability\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nDescription\\xa0of\\xa0the \\nMatter\\n\\xa0\\xa0At December\\xa031, 2022, deferred acquisition costs totaled $12.8\\xa0billion and future contract beneﬁts liabilities \\ntotaled $42.2\\xa0billion, a portion of which related to universal life-type contracts with secondary guarantees and \\nvariable annuity contracts with guaranteed beneﬁt riders.\\n \\nThe carrying amount of the deferred acquisition costs related to these products is the total of costs deferred less \\namortization, which is calculated in relation to the present value of estimated gross proﬁts of the underlying \\ncontracts. As described in Notes 1 (see section on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL) and 7 to the consolidated \\nﬁnancial statements, there is a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty inherent in calculating estimated gross proﬁts \\nas the calculation includes signiﬁcant management judgment in developing certain assumptions, such as \\nexpected future frequency and level of mortality claims, investment margins, retention and rider utilization. \\nManagement’s assumptions are adjusted, also known as unlocked, for emerging experience and expected \\nchanges in trends. The unlocking results in deferred acquisition cost amortization being recalculated, using the \\nnew assumptions for estimated gross proﬁts, that results either in additional or less cumulative amortization \\nexpense.\\n \\nThe future contract beneﬁts liability related to these product guarantees is based on estimates of how much the \\nCompany will need to pay for future beneﬁts and the amount of fees to be collected from policyholders for \\nthese policy features. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (see section on Future \\nContract Beneﬁts), there is signiﬁcant uncertainty inherent in estimating this liability because there is a \\nsigniﬁcant amount of management judgment involved in developing certain assumptions that impact the \\nliability balance, which are consistent with the assumptions used to amortize the related deferred acquisition \\ncost asset as noted above and which include expected future frequency and level of mortality claims, \\ninvestment margins, retention and rider utilization.\\n \\nAuditing the valuation of deferred acquisition costs and future contract beneﬁts liabilities related to these \\nproducts was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the high degree of \\njudgment used by management in setting the assumptions used in the estimate of both the amortization of \\ndeferred acquisition costs and the future contract beneﬁts liability related to these products.\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\nHow We Addressed \\nthe Matter in Our \\nAudit\\n  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the \\ndeferred acquisition costs and future contract beneﬁts liability estimation processes, including, among others, \\ncontrols related to the review and approval processes that management has in place for the assumptions used in \\nestimating the estimated gross proﬁts related to deferred acquisition costs and the future contract beneﬁts \\nliability. This included testing controls related to management’s evaluation of the need to update assumptions \\nbased on the comparison of actual Company experience to previous assumptions and updating investment \\nmargins for current and expected future market conditions.\\n \\nWe involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an \\nevaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the \\nsigniﬁcant assumptions used by management, we compared the signiﬁcant assumptions noted above to \\nhistorical experience, observable market data or management’s estimates of prospective changes in these \\nassumptions. In addition, we performed an independent recalculation of estimated gross proﬁts related to \\ndeferred policy acquisition costs and the future policy beneﬁt reserves for a sample of cohorts or contracts \\nwhich we compared to the actuarial model used by management.\\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n10630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 174/324Table of Contents\\n \\n\\xa0   Variable Annuity Guaranteed Living Beneﬁt Riders Embedded Derivatives\\n  \\nDescription\\xa0of\\xa0the \\nMatter\\n  The Company’s variable annuity guaranteed living beneﬁt riders include an embedded derivative, represented \\nby an asset totaling $1.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2022, related to the non-life contingent feature of the \\nproduct which is accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in income. As described in \\nNotes 1 (see section on Future Contract Beneﬁts), 5 and 20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, there is a \\nsigniﬁcant amount of estimation uncertainty inherent in measuring the fair value of the embedded derivative \\nbecause of the sensitivity of certain assumptions underlying the estimate, including stock market performance, \\npolicy lapse experience and rider utilization. Management’s assumptions are adjusted over time for emerging \\nexperience and expected changes in trends, resulting in changes to the estimated fair value of the embedded \\nderivative.\\n \\nAuditing the valuation of the embedded derivative related to variable annuity guaranteed living beneﬁt riders \\nwas complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the high degree of judgment used \\nby management in setting the assumptions used in the estimate of the value of the embedded derivative.\\n  \\nHow We Addressed \\nthe Matter in Our \\nAudit\\n  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the \\nembedded derivative estimation process, including, among others, controls related to the review and approval \\nprocesses that management has in place to develop the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the \\nembedded derivative. This included testing controls related to management’s evaluation of current and future \\nmarket conditions and the need to update policy lapse and rider utilization assumptions.\\n \\nWe involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an \\nevaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the \\nsigniﬁcant assumptions used by management, we compared the signiﬁcant assumptions noted above to \\nhistorical experience, observable market data or management’s estimates of prospective changes in these \\nassumptions.

As a result of the capital market environment \\nduring the third quarter of 2022, including (i) declining equity markets and (ii) the impact of rising interest \\nrates on the Company’s discount rate assumption, the Company accelerated the quantitative goodwill \\nimpairment test for the Life Insurance reporting unit as the Company concluded that there were indicators of \\nimpairment. Based on this quantitative test, the Company incurred an impairment during the third quarter of \\n2022 of the Life Insurance reporting unit goodwill of $634 million, which represented a write-off of the entire \\nbalance of goodwill for the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the Life Insurance reporting unit as \\npart of the goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to signiﬁcant assumptions such as the discount rate, and \\nother relevant assumptions impacting projected ﬁnancial information, including policyholder behavior \\nassumptions, and those impacted by market or economic conditions.\\n \\nAuditing the fair value of the Company’s Life Insurance reporting unit was complex and required the \\ninvolvement of our valuation and actuarial specialists due to the high degree of judgment used by management.\\n  \\nHow We Addressed \\nthe Matter in Our \\nAudit\\n  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the \\nCompany’s goodwill impairment review process. This included, among others, controls related to the review \\nand approval processes that management has in place to develop the assumptions used in the estimation \\nprocess, including management’s determination of the applicable discount rate, and the proﬁtability of in-force \\nbusiness including policyholder behavior assumptions for the Life Insurance reporting unit.\\n \\nWe involved actuarial and valuation specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among \\nothers, an evaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To \\nassess the signiﬁcant assumptions used by management, we compared the signiﬁcant assumptions noted above \\nto current industry and economic trends and recent market transactions. We reviewed the historical accuracy of \\nmanagement’s estimate and performed sensitivity analyses of signiﬁcant assumptions to evaluate the changes \\nin the fair value of the Life Insurance reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions.\\n \\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1966.\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\\nFebruary\\xa016, 2023\\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 175/324 \\n10730/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 176/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nLINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n(in millions, except share data)\\n \\n   \\n          \\n  As of December 31, \\n  2022   2021  \\n         \\nASSETS         \\nInvestments:         \\nFixed maturity available-for-sale securities, at fair value         \\n(amortized cost: 2022 -

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies\\n \\nNature of Operations \\n \\nLincoln National Corporation and its subsidiaries (“LNC” or the “Company,” which also may be referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) \\noperate multiple insurance businesses through four business segments.  See Note 21 for additional details.  The collective group of \\nbusinesses uses “Lincoln Financial Group” as its marketing identity.  Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth \\nprotection, accumulation, group protection and retirement income products and solutions.  These products primarily include universal \\nlife insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-beneﬁt UL and VUL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), \\nterm life insurance, ﬁxed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, group life, disability and dental and employer-sponsored retirement \\nplans and services.\\n \\nBasis of Presentation \\n \\nThe accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted \\naccounting principles (“GAAP”).  Certain GAAP policies, which signiﬁcantly affect the determination of ﬁnancial condition, results of \\noperations and cash ﬂows, are summarized below.\\n \\nCertain amounts reported in prior year’s Consolidated Balance Sheets have been reclassiﬁed to conform to the presentation adopted in \\nthe current year.  Speciﬁcally, we reclassiﬁed premiums and fees receivable and funds withheld reinsurance assets to other assets.  We \\nalso reclassiﬁed reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and funds withheld reinsurance liabilities to other liabilities.  These \\nreclassiﬁcations had no effect on total assets, total liabilities or stockholders’ equity for the prior year.\\n \\nSummary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies \\n \\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n \\nThe accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of LNC and all other entities in which we have a controlling \\nﬁnancial interest and any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are the primary beneﬁciary.  We use the equity method of \\naccounting to recognize all of our investments in limited liability partnerships.  All material inter-company accounts and transactions \\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.  \\n \\nOur involvement with VIEs is primarily to invest in assets that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversiﬁed portfolio of asset \\nclasses.  A VIE is an entity that does not have sufﬁcient equity to ﬁnance its own activities without additional ﬁnancial support or where \\ninvestors lack certain characteristics of a controlling ﬁnancial interest.  We assess our contractual, ownership or other interests in a VIE \\nto determine if our interest participates in the variability the VIE was designed to absorb and pass onto variable interest holders.  We \\nperform an ongoing qualitative assessment of our variable interests in VIEs to determine whether we have a controlling ﬁnancial \\ninterest and would therefore be considered the primary beneﬁciary of the VIE.  If we determine we are the primary beneﬁciary of a \\nVIE, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\\n \\nAccounting Estimates and Assumptions\\n \\nThe preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting \\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the ﬁnancial \\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  In applying these estimates and assumptions, \\nmanagement makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are uncertain and \\ninherently subject to change, including matters related to or impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Actual results could differ from \\nthese estimates and assumptions.  Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require \\nextensive use of estimates are:  fair value of certain ﬁnancial assets, derivatives, allowances for credit losses, deferred acquisition costs \\n(“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), goodwill and other intangibles, future contract \\nbeneﬁts, other contract holder funds including deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”), pension plans, stock-based incentive compensation, \\nincome taxes including the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, and the potential effects of resolving litigated matters.\\n \\nBusiness Combinations\\n \\nWe\\xa0use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combination transactions, and accordingly, recognize the fair values of \\nassets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.  The allocation of fair \\nvalues may be subject to adjustment after the initial allocation for up to a one-year period as more information becomes available \\nrelative to the fair values as of the acquisition date.  The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the results of operations of any \\nacquired company since the acquisition date.\\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 183/32411230/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 184/324Table of Contents\\n \\nFair Value Measurement\\n \\nOur measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include \\ninherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or non-performance risk (“NPR”), which would include our own credit risk.  Our \\nestimate of an exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability \\n(“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as \\nopposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a liability (“entry price”).  Pursuant to the Fair Value \\nMeasurements and Disclosures Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodiﬁcationTM \\n(“ASC”), we categorize our ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of \\ninputs to the respective valuation technique.  The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is deﬁned as follows:\\n \\n\\x00Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the \\nreporting date, except for large holdings subject to “blockage discounts” that are excluded;\\n\\x00Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly \\nobservable as of the reporting date, and fair value can be determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies; \\nand\\n\\x00Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in situations where there is little or no market activity for \\nthe asset or liability, and we make estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the asset or liability, including assumptions \\nregarding risk.\\n \\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the level \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of \\nthe signiﬁcance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors speciﬁc to the \\ninvestment. \\n \\nWhen a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the determination is based upon \\nthe signiﬁcance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.  Because certain securities trade in less liquid or \\nilliquid markets with limited or no pricing information, the determination of fair value for these securities is inherently more difﬁcult.  \\nHowever, Level 3 fair value investments may include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 inputs, observable components, which \\nare components that are actively quoted or can be validated to market-based sources.\\n \\nFixed Maturity Available-For-Sale Securities – Fair Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs\\n \\nSecurities classiﬁed as available-for-sale (“AFS”) consist of ﬁxed maturity securities and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains \\nand losses included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”), net of associated DAC, VOBA, DSI, future \\ncontract beneﬁts, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes.  \\n \\nWe measure the fair value of our securities classiﬁed as ﬁxed maturity AFS based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing \\nthe security.  The most appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the speciﬁc characteristics of the ﬁxed maturity security, \\nand we consistently apply the valuation methodology to measure the security’s fair value.  Our fair value measurement is based on a \\nmarket approach that utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable \\nsecurities.  Sources of inputs to the market approach primarily include third-party pricing services, independent broker quotations or \\npricing matrices.  We do not adjust prices received from third parties; however, we do analyze the third-party pricing services’ valuation \\nmethodologies and related inputs and perform additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy.\\n \\nThe observable and unobservable inputs to our valuation methodologies are based on a set of standard inputs that we generally use to \\nevaluate all of our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities.  Observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, \\nissuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In addition, market indicators, industry and \\neconomic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met.  For certain security types, additional \\ninputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be applicable.  For private placement securities, we use pricing \\nmatrices that utilize observable pricing inputs of similar public securities and Treasury yields as inputs to the fair value measurement.  \\nDepending on the type of security or the daily market activity, standard inputs may be prioritized differently or may not be available for \\nall ﬁxed maturity AFS securities on any given day.  For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or \\nbroker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants.  For securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with \\nlimited or no pricing information, we use unobservable inputs to measure fair value.  \\n \\n11330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 185/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe following summarizes our fair valuation methodologies and associated inputs, which are particular to the speciﬁed security type \\nand are in addition to the deﬁned standard inputs to our valuation methodologies for all of our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities discussed \\nabove:\\n \\n\\x00Corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds – We also use Trade Reporting and Compliance EngineTM reported tables for our \\ncorporate bonds and vendor trading platform data for our U.S. government bonds.  \\n\\x00Mortgage- and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) – We also utilize additional inputs, which include new issues data, monthly \\npayment information and monthly collateral performance, including prepayments, severity, delinquencies, step-down features and \\nover collateralization features for each of our mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), which include collateralized mortgage \\nobligations and mortgage pass through securities backed by residential mortgages (“RMBS”), commercial mortgage-backed \\nsecurities (“CMBS”) and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).\\n\\x00State and municipal bonds – We also use additional inputs that include information from the Municipal Securities Rule Making \\nBoard, as well as material event notices, new issue data, issuer ﬁnancial statements and Municipal Market Data benchmark yields \\nfor our state and municipal bonds.\\n\\x00Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities – We also utilize additional inputs of exchange prices (underlying and common stock \\nof the same issuer) for our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities.\\n \\nIn order to validate the pricing information and broker-dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons \\nwith similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales and observations of general market movements for those security \\nclasses.  We have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by our third-party pricing service and the output \\nthat is provided to us by the pricing service.  On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and \\nassumptions used by the pricing service, and we perform a comparison of the pricing service output to an alternative pricing source. \\n\\xa0We also evaluate prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the \\nprices for\\xa0unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters\\xa0or for lack of change from one period to the next.\\xa0\\n \\nFixed Maturity AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost\\n \\nWe regularly review our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities (also referred to as “debt securities”) for declines in fair value that we determine \\nto be impairment-related, including those attributable to credit risk factors that may require a credit loss allowance.\\n \\nFor our debt securities, we generally consider the following to determine whether our debt securities with unrealized losses are credit \\nimpaired:\\n \\n\\x00The estimated range and average period until recovery;\\n\\x00The estimated range and average holding period to maturity;\\n\\x00Remaining payment terms of the security;\\n\\x00Current delinquencies and nonperforming assets of underlying collateral;\\n\\x00Expected future default rates;\\n\\x00Collateral value by vintage, geographic region, industry concentration or property type; \\n\\x00Subordination levels or other credit enhancements as of the balance sheet date as compared to origination; and\\n\\x00Contractual and regulatory cash obligations.\\n \\nFor a debt security, if we intend to sell a security, or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery \\nof its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we conclude that an impairment has occurred \\nand the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  If we do not intend to sell a debt security, or it is not more likely than not we will be \\nrequired to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash ﬂows expected to be \\ncollected is less than the amortized cost of the debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an impairment has \\noccurred, and a credit loss allowance is recorded, with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss).  The remainder of the decline to fair value related to factors other than credit loss is recorded in other \\ncomprehensive income (“OCI”) to unrealized losses on ﬁxed maturity AFS securities on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ \\nEquity, as this amount is considered a noncredit impairment.\\n \\n11430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 186/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nWhen assessing our intent to sell a debt security, or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before \\nrecovery of its cost basis, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, \\nsales of securities to meet cash ﬂow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.  Management considers the \\nfollowing as part of the evaluation:\\n \\n\\x00The current economic environment and market conditions;\\n\\x00Our business strategy and current business plans;\\n\\x00The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate \\nrisk;\\n\\x00Our analysis of data from ﬁnancial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our \\nhedging and overall risk management strategies;\\n\\x00The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments \\nand expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\\n\\x00The capital risk limits approved by management; and\\n\\x00Our current ﬁnancial condition and liquidity demands.\\n \\nIn order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security, we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash \\nﬂow analysis based on the current cash ﬂows and future cash ﬂows we expect to recover.  The discount rate is the effective interest rate \\nimplicit in the underlying debt security.  The effective interest rate is the original yield, or the coupon if the debt security was \\npreviously impaired.  See the discussion below for additional information on the methodology and signiﬁcant inputs, by security type, \\nthat we use to determine the amount of a credit loss.\\n \\nTo determine the recovery period of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer \\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\\n \\n\\x00Historical and implied volatility of the security;\\n\\x00The extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; \\n\\x00Adverse conditions speciﬁcally related to the security or to speciﬁc conditions in an industry or geographic area; \\n\\x00Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and\\n\\x00Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. \\n \\nIn periods subsequent to the recognition of a credit loss impairment through a credit loss allowance, we continue to reassess the \\nexpected cash ﬂows of the debt security at each subsequent measurement date as necessary.  If the measurement of credit loss changes, \\nwe recognize a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense through realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss), limited by the amount that amortized cost exceeds fair value.  Losses are charged against the allowance \\nfor credit losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a debt security is conﬁrmed or when either of the criteria regarding \\nintent or requirement to sell is met.  Accrued interest on debt securities is written-off when deemed uncollectible.\\n \\nTo determine the recovery value of a corporate bond or CLO, we perform additional analysis related to the underlying issuer including, \\nbut not limited to, the following:\\n \\n\\x00Fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to ﬁle bankruptcy versus the price at which the market \\nis trading;\\n\\x00Fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates;\\n\\x00Earnings multiples for the given industry or sector of an industry that the underlying issuer operates within, divided by the \\noutstanding debt to determine an expected recovery value of the security in the case of a liquidation;\\n\\x00Expected cash ﬂows of the issuer (e.g., whether the issuer has cash ﬂows in excess of what is required to fund its operations);\\n\\x00Expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates;\\n\\x00Changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and\\n\\x00Additional market information (e.g., if there has been a replacement of the corporate debt security).\\n \\n11530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 187/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nEach quarter, we review the cash flows for the MBS portfolio, including current credit enhancements and trends in the underlying \\ncollateral performance to determine whether or not they are sufficient to provide for the recovery of our amortized cost.  To \\ndetermine recovery value of a MBS, we perform additional analysis related to the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the \\nfollowing:\\n \\n\\x00Discounted cash ﬂow analysis based on the current cash ﬂows and future cash ﬂows we expect to recover;\\n\\x00Level of borrower creditworthiness of the home equity loans or residential mortgages that back an RMBS or commercial \\nmortgages that back a CMBS;\\n\\x00Susceptibility to fair value ﬂuctuations for changes in the interest rate environment;\\n\\x00Susceptibility to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are lower than the securities’ book yield earned;\\n\\x00Susceptibility to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are higher than the book yields earned on a security; \\n\\x00Expectations of sale of such a security where market yields are higher than the book yields earned on a security; and \\n\\x00Susceptibility to variability of prepayments.\\n \\nWhen evaluating MBS and mortgage-related ABS, we consider a number of pool-speciﬁc factors as well as market level factors when \\ndetermining whether or not the impairment on the security requires a credit loss allowance.  The most important factor is the \\nperformance of the underlying collateral in the security and the trends of that performance in the prior periods.  We use this information \\nabout the collateral to forecast the timing and rate of mortgage loan defaults, including making projections for loans that are already \\ndelinquent and for those loans that are currently performing but may become delinquent in the future.  Other factors used in this \\nanalysis include the credit characteristics of borrowers, geographic distribution of underlying loans and timing of liquidations by state.  \\nOnce default rates and timing assumptions are determined, we then make assumptions regarding the severity of a default if it were to \\noccur.  Factors that impact the severity assumption include expectations for future home price appreciation or depreciation, loan size, \\nﬁrst lien versus second lien, existence of loan level private mortgage insurance, type of occupancy and geographic distribution of loans.  \\nOnce default and severity assumptions are determined for the security in question, cash ﬂows for the underlying collateral are projected \\nincluding expected defaults and prepayments.  These cash ﬂows on the collateral are then translated to cash ﬂows on our tranche based \\non the cash ﬂow waterfall of the entire capital security structure.  If this analysis indicates the entire principal on a particular security \\nwill not be returned, the security is reviewed for a credit loss by comparing the expected cash ﬂows to amortized cost.  To the extent \\nthat the security has already been impaired through a credit loss allowance or was purchased at a discount, such that the amortized cost \\nof the security is less than or equal to the present value of cash ﬂows expected to be collected, no credit loss allowance is required.  \\nOtherwise, if the amortized cost of the security is greater than the present value of the cash ﬂows expected to be collected, and the \\nsecurity was not purchased at a discount greater than the expected principal loss, then an impairment through a credit loss allowance is \\nrecognized.\\n \\nWe further monitor the cash ﬂows of all of our debt securities backed by mortgages on an ongoing basis.  We also perform detailed \\nanalysis on all of our subprime, Alt-A, non-agency residential MBS and on a signiﬁcant percentage of our debt securities backed by \\npools of commercial mortgages.  The detailed analysis includes revising projected cash ﬂows by updating the cash ﬂows for actual cash \\nreceived and applying assumptions with respect to expected defaults, foreclosures and recoveries in the future.  These revised projected \\ncash ﬂows are then compared to the amount of credit enhancement (subordination) in the structure to determine whether the amortized \\ncost of the security is recoverable.  If it is not recoverable, we record an impairment through a credit loss allowance for the security.\\n \\nTrading Securities\\n \\nTrading securities consist of ﬁxed maturity securities in designated portfolios, some of which support modiﬁed coinsurance and \\ncoinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements.  Investment results for the portfolios that support modiﬁed coinsurance and \\ncoinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers \\npursuant to contractual terms of the reinsurance agreements.  Trading securities are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value and \\nchanges in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities associated with the underlying reinsurance agreements are recorded in \\nrealized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as they occur. \\n \\nEquity Securities\\n \\nEquity securities are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value are recorded in realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements \\nof Comprehensive Income (Loss) as they occur.  Equity securities consist primarily of common stock of publicly-traded companies, \\nprivately placed securities and mutual fund shares.  We measure the fair value of our equity securities based on assumptions used by \\nmarket participants in pricing the security.  The most appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the speciﬁc characteristics \\nof the equity security.  Fair values of publicly-traded equity securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical \\nor comparable securities.  When quoted prices are not available, we use valuation methodologies most appropriate for the speciﬁc asset.  \\nFair values for private placement securities are determined using discounted cash ﬂow, earnings multiple and other valuation models.  \\nThe fair values of mutual fund shares that transact regularly are based on transaction prices of identical fund shares. \\n \\n \\n \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 188/324 \\n11630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 189/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nMortgage Loans on Real Estate\\n \\nMortgage loans on real estate consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans and are generally carried at unpaid principal \\nbalances adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts and are net of allowance for credit losses.  We carry certain \\ncommercial mortgage loans at fair value where the fair value option has been elected.  Interest income is accrued on the principal \\nbalance of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate.  Premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective yield method \\nover the life of the loan.  Interest income and amortization of premiums and discounts are reported in net investment income on the \\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) along with mortgage loan fees, which are recorded as they are incurred.\\n \\nOur policy for commercial mortgage loans is to report loans that are 60 or more days past due, which equates to two or more payments \\nmissed, as delinquent.  Our policy for residential mortgage loans is to report loans that are 90 or more days past due, which equates to \\nthree or more payments missed, as delinquent.  We do not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due, and any interest received on these \\nloans is either applied to the principal or recorded in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \\n(Loss) when received, depending on the assessment of the collectability of the loan.  We resume accruing interest once a loan complies \\nwith all of its original terms or restructured terms.  Mortgage loans deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit \\nlosses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are likewise credited to the allowance for credit losses.  Accrued interest on mortgage loans is \\nwritten-off when deemed uncollectible.\\n \\nIn connection with our recognition of an allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans on real estate, we perform a quantitative \\nanalysis using a probability of default/loss given default/exposure at default approach to estimate expected credit losses in our mortgage \\nloan portfolio as well as unfunded commitments related to commercial mortgage loans, exclusive of certain mortgage loans held at fair \\nvalue.  Our model estimates expected credit losses over the contractual terms of the loans, which are the periods over which we are \\nexposed to credit risk, adjusted for expected prepayments.  Credit loss estimates are segmented by commercial mortgage loans, \\nresidential mortgage loans, and unfunded commitments related to commercial mortgage loans.\\n \\nThe allowance for credit losses for pooled loans of similar risk (i.e., commercial and residential mortgage loans) is estimated using \\nrelevant historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions.  \\nHistorical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with adjustments for differences in \\ncurrent loan-speciﬁc risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term lengths \\nas well as adjustments for changes in environmental conditions, such as unemployment rates, property values, or other factors that \\nmanagement deems relevant.  We apply probability weights to the positive, base and adverse scenarios we use.  For periods beyond our \\nreasonable and supportable forecast, we use implicit mean reversion over the remaining life of the recoverable, meaning our model will \\ninherently revert to the baseline scenario as the baseline is representative of the historical average over a longer period of time.\\n \\nLoans are considered impaired when it is probable that, based upon current information and events, we will be unable to collect all \\namounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  When we determine that a loan is impaired, a speciﬁc credit loss \\nallowance is established for the excess carrying value of the loan over its estimated value.  The loan’s estimated value is based on:  the \\npresent value of expected future cash ﬂows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; the loan’s observable market price; or the fair \\nvalue of the loan’s collateral.\\n \\nAllowance for credit losses are maintained at a level we believe is adequate to absorb current expected lifetime credit losses.  Our \\nperiodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on historical loss experience, known and inherent risks in \\nthe portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated \\nvalue of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts \\nabout the future and other relevant factors.\\n \\nMortgage loans on real estate are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in the \\nallowance are reported in realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Mortgage loans on \\nreal estate deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to \\nthe allowance for credit losses, limited to the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\\n \\nOur commercial loan portfolio is primarily comprised of long-term loans secured by existing commercial real estate.  We believe all of \\nthe commercial loans in our portfolio share three primary risks:  borrower credit worthiness; sustainability of the cash ﬂow of the \\nproperty; and market risk; therefore, our methods of monitoring and assessing credit risk are consistent for our entire portfolio.\\n \\nFor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, trends in market vacancy and rental rates are incorporated into the analysis that we \\nperform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses.  \\nIn addition, we review each loan individually in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on an annual basis to identify emerging risks.  \\nWe focus on properties that experienced a reduction in debt-service coverage or that have signiﬁcant exposure to tenants with \\ndeteriorating credit proﬁles.  Where warranted, we establish or increase a credit loss allowance for a speciﬁc loan based upon this \\nanalysis.  \\n \\nWe measure and assess the credit quality of our commercial mortgage loans by using loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios.  \\nThe loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value at origination of the underlying property 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 190/324collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage.  Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the principal \\namount is greater \\n11730/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 191/324Table of Contents\\n \\nthan the collateral value.  Therefore, all else being equal, a lower loan-to-value ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan.  The debt-\\nservice coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments.  Debt-service coverage ratios of less \\nthan 1.0 indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments.  Therefore, all else being \\nequal, a higher debt-service coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan.  These credit quality metrics are monitored and \\nreviewed at least annually.\\n \\nWe have off-balance sheet commitments related to commercial mortgage loans.  As such, an allowance for credit losses is developed \\nbased on the commercial mortgage loan process outlined above, along with an internally developed conversion factor.\\n \\nOur residential loan portfolio is primarily comprised of ﬁrst lien mortgages secured by existing residential real estate.  In contrast to the \\ncommercial mortgage loan portfolio, residential mortgage loans are primarily smaller-balance homogenous loans that share similar risk \\ncharacteristics.  Therefore, these pools of loans are collectively evaluated for inherent credit losses.  Such evaluations consider \\nnumerous factors, including, but not limited to borrower credit scores, collateral values, loss forecasts, geographic location, \\ndelinquency rates and economic trends.  These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information \\nbecomes available, including updated forecasts, which can cause the allowance for credit losses to increase or decrease over time as \\nsuch evaluations are revised.  Generally, residential mortgage loan pools exclude loans that are nonperforming, as those loans are \\nevaluated individually using the evaluation framework for speciﬁc allowance for credit losses described above.\\n \\nFor residential mortgage loans, our primary credit quality indicator is whether the loan is performing or nonperforming.  We generally \\ndeﬁne nonperforming residential mortgage loans as those that are 90 or more days past due and/or in nonaccrual status.  There is \\ngenerally a higher risk of experiencing credit losses when a residential mortgage loan is nonperforming.  We monitor and update aging \\nschedules and nonaccrual status on a monthly basis.\\n \\nPolicy Loans \\n \\nPolicy loans represent loans we issue to contract holders that use the cash surrender value of their life insurance policy as collateral.  \\nPolicy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances.  \\n \\nDerivative Instruments\\n \\nWe hedge certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk and credit risk by \\nentering into derivative transactions.  Our derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets at estimated fair value.  We have master netting agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that allow for the \\nnetting of our derivative asset and liability positions by counterparty.  We categorized derivatives into a three-level hierarchy, based on \\nthe priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique as discussed above in “Fair Value Measurement.”  The accounting for \\nchanges in the estimated fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualiﬁes as part of a \\nhedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify \\nas hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged:  as a cash ﬂow hedge or a fair \\nvalue hedge.\\n \\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash ﬂow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the \\nderivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassiﬁed into net income in the same period or periods during which \\nthe hedged transaction affects net income.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change \\nin the present value of designated future cash ﬂows of the hedged item (hedge ineffectiveness), if any, is recognized in net income \\nduring the period of change.  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the \\nderivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in net \\nincome during the period of change in estimated fair values.  For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, but that \\nare economic hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in net income.\\n \\nWe purchase and issue ﬁnancial instruments and products that contain embedded derivative instruments that are recorded with the \\nassociated host contract.  When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly \\nand closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as \\na derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes and reported within other assets \\nor other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The embedded derivative is carried at fair value with changes in fair value \\nrecognized in net income during the period of change.  \\n \\nWe employ several different methods for determining the fair value of our derivative instruments.  The fair value of our derivative \\ncontracts are measured based on current settlement values, which are based on quoted market prices, industry standard models that are \\ncommercially available and broker quotes.  These techniques project cash ﬂows of the derivatives using current and implied future \\nmarket conditions.  We calculate the present value of the cash ﬂows to measure the current fair market value of the derivative. \\n \\n11830/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 192/324Table of Contents\\n \\nOther Investments\\n \\nOther investments consist primarily of alternative investments, cash collateral receivables related to our derivative instruments, Federal \\nHome Loan Bank (“FHLB”) common stock and short-term investments.\\n \\nAlternative investments consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships (“LPs”).  We account for our investments in LPs using \\nthe equity method to determine the carrying value.  Recognition of alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of \\nthe related ﬁnancial statements, which are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners.  As a result, our private equity \\ninvestments are generally on a three-month delay and our hedge funds are on a one-month delay.  In addition, the impact of audit \\nadjustments related to completion of calendar-year ﬁnancial statement audits of the investees are typically received during the second \\nquarter of each calendar year.  Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar-year period may not \\ninclude the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar-year period.  \\n \\nIn uncleared derivative transactions, we and the counterparty enter into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral, \\nwhich may be in the form of cash, equal to the net derivative exposure.  Cash collateral we have posted to a counterparty is recorded \\nwithin other investments.  Cash collateral a counterparty has posted is recorded within payables for collateral on investments.  We also \\nhave investments in FHLB common stock, carried at cost, that enable access to the FHLB lending program.  For more information on \\nour collateralized ﬁnancing arrangements, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” below.  \\n \\nShort-term investments consist of securities with original maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months.  Securities \\nincluded in short-term investments are carried at fair value, with valuation methods and inputs consistent with those applied to ﬁxed \\nmaturity AFS securities.\\n \\nCash and Invested Cash\\n \\nCash and invested cash is carried at cost and includes all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three \\nmonths or less.\\n \\nDAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL\\n \\nAcquisition costs directly related to successful contract acquisitions or renewals of UL, VUL, traditional life insurance, group life and \\ndisability insurance, annuities and other investment contracts have been deferred (i.e., DAC) to the extent recoverable.  Such \\nacquisition costs are capitalized in the period they are incurred and primarily include commissions, certain bonuses, portion of total \\ncompensation and beneﬁts of certain employees involved in the acquisition process and medical and inspection fees.  VOBA is an \\nintangible asset that reﬂects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the \\nportion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash ﬂows from the business in force at the \\nacquisition date.  Bonus credits and excess interest for dollar cost averaging contracts are considered DSI, and the unamortized balance \\nis reported within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Contract sales charges that are collected in the early years of an \\ninsurance contract are deferred (i.e., DFEL), and the unamortized balance is reported in other contract holder funds on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets.  \\n \\nBoth DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding amounts reported in realized gain (loss), is reported within commissions and other \\nexpenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  DSI amortization, excluding amounts reported in realized \\ngain (loss), is reported in interest credited on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The amortization of \\nDFEL, excluding amounts reported in realized gain (loss), is reported within fee income on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss).  The methodology for determining the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL varies by product \\ntype.  Amortization is based on assumptions consistent with those used in the development of the underlying contract adjusted for \\nemerging experience and expected trends.  \\n \\nThe carrying amounts of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are adjusted for the effects of realized and unrealized gains and losses on \\nsecurities classiﬁed as ﬁxed maturity AFS and certain derivatives and embedded derivatives.  Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, \\nDSI and DFEL reﬂects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment \\nlosses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization within realized gain (loss) on the \\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) reﬂecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related \\ninvestment losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments can create volatility from period to period in realized gain (loss).  \\n \\nWe account for modiﬁcations of insurance contracts that result in a substantially unchanged contract as a continuation of the replaced \\ncontract.\\xa0 We account for modiﬁcations of insurance contracts that result in a substantially changed contract as an extinguishment of the \\nreplaced contract.\\n \\nFor reinsurance transactions where we receive proceeds that represent recovery of our previously incurred acquisition costs, we reduce \\nthe applicable unamortized acquisition costs such that the net acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to commissions and other \\nexpenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\\n \\n11930/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 193/32430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 194/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nAcquisition costs for all traditional contracts, including term life insurance, individual whole life and group business, are amortized \\nover the premium-paying period or level term period, depending on the contract, which generally results in amortization less than or \\nequal to 30 years.  Acquisition costs are either amortized on a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related policies \\ndepending on the block of business.\\xa0 There is currently no intangible balance or related amortization for ﬁxed and variable payout \\nannuities.\\n \\nAcquisition costs for UL and VUL insurance and investment-type products, which include ﬁxed and variable deferred annuities, are \\ngenerally amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the incidence of estimated gross proﬁts (“EGPs”) from surrender \\ncharges, investment, death beneﬁts expected to be paid, net of reinsurance ceded and expense margins and actual realized gain (loss) on \\ninvestments.\\xa0 Contract lives for UL and VUL policies are estimated to be 40 years based on the expected lives of the contracts.\\xa0 \\nContract lives for ﬁxed and variable deferred annuities are generally between 15 and 30 years, while some of our ﬁxed multi-year \\nguarantee products have amortization periods equal to the guarantee period.\\xa0 The front-end load annuity product has an assumed life of \\n25 years.\\xa0 Longer lives are assigned to those blocks that have demonstrated lower lapse experience.\\xa0 \\n \\nDuring the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our \\nestimates of future gross proﬁts underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  These assumptions include, but are not \\nlimited to, capital markets, investment margins, mortality rates, retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated \\nwith maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity contracts, and with the processing of premium \\ncollections, deposits, withdrawals and commissions).  Based on our review, the cumulative balances of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL \\nincluded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are adjusted with an offsetting beneﬁt or charge to revenue or amortization expense to \\nreﬂect such change related to our expectations of future EGPs (“unlocking”).  We may have unlocking in other quarters as we become \\naware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our comprehensive review.  We may also identify and implement \\nactuarial modeling reﬁnements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL. \\n\\xa0\\nDAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are reviewed to ensure that the unamortized portion does not exceed the expected recoverable amounts. \\n \\nReinsurance\\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries enter into reinsurance agreements in the normal course of business to limit our exposure to the risk of loss \\nand to enhance our capital management.\\n \\nIn order for a reinsurance agreement to qualify for reinsurance accounting, the agreement must satisfy certain risk transfer conditions \\nthat include, among other items,\\xa0a reasonable possibility of a signiﬁcant loss for the assuming entity.\\xa0 When we apply reinsurance \\naccounting, premiums, beneﬁts and DAC amortization are reported net of reinsurance ceded on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss).\\xa0 Amounts currently recoverable, such as ceded reserves, are reported in reinsurance recoverables and \\namounts currently payable to the reinsurers, such as premiums, are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\xa0 \\nAssets and liabilities and revenues and expenses from certain reinsurance contracts that grant statutory surplus relief to our insurance \\ncompanies are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively, \\nif there is a contractual right of offset.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n \\nWe use deposit accounting to recognize reinsurance agreements that do not transfer signiﬁcant insurance risk.  This accounting \\ntreatment results in amounts paid or received by our insurance subsidiaries to be considered on deposit with the reinsurer and such \\namounts are reported in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\xa0 As amounts are paid or \\nreceived, consistent with the underlying contracts, deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted.\\n \\nWe estimated an allowance for credit losses for all reinsurance recoverables and related reinsurance deposit assets held by our \\nsubsidiaries.  As such, we performed a quantitative analysis using a probability of loss model approach to estimate expected credit \\nlosses for reinsurance recoverables, inclusive of similar assets recognized using the deposit method of accounting.  The credit loss \\nallowance is a general allowance for pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics segmented by credit risk ratings and \\nreceivables assessed on an individual basis that do not share similar risk characteristics where we anticipate a credit loss over the life of \\nreinsurance-related assets.\\n \\nOur model uses relevant internal or external historical loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable \\nforecasts of future events and conditions in developing our credit loss estimate.  We utilized historical credit rating data to form an \\nestimation of probability of default of counterparties by means of a transition matrix that provides the rates of credit migration for credit \\nratings transitioning to impairment.  We updated reinsurer credit ratings during the period to incorporate the most up-to-date \\ninformation on the current state of the ﬁnancial stability of our reinsurers.  To simulate changes in economic conditions, we used \\npositive, base and adverse scenarios that include varying levels of loss given default assumptions to reﬂect the impact of changes in \\nseverity of losses.  We applied probability weights to the positive, base and adverse scenarios.  For periods beyond our reasonable and \\nsupportable forecasts, we used implicit mean reversion over the remaining life of the recoverable.  Additionally, we considered factors \\nthat impact our exposure at default that are driven by actuarial expectations around term assumptions rather than being directly driven \\nby market or economic environment. \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 195/324Our model estimates the expected credit losses over the life of the reinsurance asset.

For reinsurance recoverables that do not share similar risk characteristics, we assessed on an individual basis to determine \\na speciﬁc credit loss allowance. \\n \\nWe estimated expected credit losses over the contractual term of the recoverable, which is the period during which we are exposed to \\nthe credit risk.  Reinsurance recoverables may not have explicit contractual lives, but are tied to the underlying insurance products; as a \\nresult, we estimated the contractual life by utilizing actuarial estimates of the timing of payouts related to those underlying products. \\n \\nReinsurance agreements often require the reinsurer to collateralize the recoverable with funds in a trust account or with a letter of credit \\nfor the beneﬁt of the ceding insurance entity that can reduce the expected credit losses on a given agreement.  As such, we review \\nreinsurance collateral by individual agreement to sensitize risk of loss based on level of collateralization.  This review is driven by the \\nassumption that non-collateralized reinsurance recoverables would have materially higher losses in times of default.  Therefore, \\nreinsurance recoverables are pooled as either fully-collateralized or non-collateralized.\\n \\nReinsurance recoverables are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in the \\nallowance for credit losses are reported in realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  \\nReinsurance recoverables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, \\nare credited to the allowance for credit losses, limited to the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-\\noff.\\n \\nGoodwill\\n \\nWe recognize the excess of the purchase price, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of \\nidentiﬁable net assets acquired as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of October\\xa01 and \\nmore frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit \\nbelow its carrying value.  \\n \\nWe perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test where the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the \\ncarrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is \\nimpaired and written down to the reporting unit’s fair value; and a charge is reported in impairment of intangibles on the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The results of one goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit cannot subsidize the \\nresults of another reporting unit. \\n \\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\\n \\nOther assets consist primarily of certain reinsurance assets, net of allowance for credit losses, certain guaranteed living beneﬁt (“GLB”) \\nfeatures, current and deferred taxes, premiums and fees receivable, property and equipment owned by the Company, balances \\nassociated with corporate-owned and bank-owned life insurance, receivables resulting from sales of securities that had not yet settled as \\nof the balance sheet date, speciﬁcally identiﬁable intangible assets, DSI, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other \\nreceivables and prepaid expenses.  Other liabilities consist primarily of certain reinsurance payables, certain GLB features, current and \\ndeferred taxes, pension and other employee beneﬁt liabilities, deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance, derivative instrument \\nliabilities, payables resulting from purchases of securities that had not yet settled as of the balance sheet date, long-term operating lease \\nliabilities, certain ﬁnancing arrangements, ﬁnance lease liabilities and other accrued expenses.\\n \\nThe carrying values of speciﬁcally identiﬁable intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for indicators of impairment in value that \\nare related to credit loss or non-credit, including unexpected or adverse changes in the following:\\xa0 the economic or competitive \\nenvironments in which the company operates; proﬁtability analyses; cash ﬂow analyses; and the fair value of the relevant business \\noperation.\\xa0 If there was an indication of impairment, then the discounted cash ﬂow method would be used to measure the impairment, \\nand the carrying value would be adjusted as necessary and reported in impairment of intangibles on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss).\\xa0 Sales force intangibles are attributable to the value of the new business distribution system acquired \\nthrough business combinations.\\xa0 These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life of 25 years.  Speciﬁcally \\nidentiﬁable intangible assets also includes the value of customer relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) and value of distribution \\nagreements (“VODA”).  The carrying values of VOCRA and VODA are amortized using a straight-line basis over their weighted \\naverage life of 20 years and 13 years, respectively.  See Note 9 for more information regarding speciﬁcally identiﬁable intangible \\nassets. \\n \\nProperty and equipment owned for company use is carried at cost less allowances for depreciation.\\xa0 Provisions for depreciation of \\ninvestment real estate and property and equipment owned for company use are computed principally on the straight-line method over \\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which include buildings, computer hardware and software and other property and equipment.\\xa0 \\nCertain assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are related to ﬁnance leases and certain ﬁnancing arrangements and are depreciated \\nin a manner consistent with our current depreciation policy for owned assets.  We periodically review the carrying value of our long-\\nlived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of \\nsuch assets may not be fully recoverable.\\xa0 For long-lived assets to be held and used, impairments are recognized when the carrying \\namount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\\xa0 The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable \\nif it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash ﬂows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.\\xa0 An \\nimpairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 197/324 \\n12130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 198/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of by abandonment or in an exchange for a similar productive long-lived asset are classiﬁed as held-\\nfor-use until they are disposed.  Long-lived assets to be sold are classiﬁed as held-for-sale and are no longer depreciated.\\xa0 Certain \\ncriteria have to be met in order for the long-lived asset to be classiﬁed as held-for-sale, including that a sale is probable and expected to \\noccur within one year.\\xa0 Long-lived assets classiﬁed as held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less \\ncost to sell.\\n \\nWe lease ofﬁce space and certain equipment under various long-term lease agreements.  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at \\ninception.  Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum \\nlease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.  Our leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, we use our \\nincremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.  The ROU asset is \\ncalculated using the lease liability carrying amount, plus or minus prepaid/accrued lease payments, minus the unamortized balance of \\nlease incentives received, plus unamortized initial direct costs.  Lease terms used to calculate our lease obligation include options when \\nwe are reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.  Our lease agreements may contain both lease and non-lease components, \\nwhich are accounted for separately.  Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nterm.\\n \\nOther liabilities include deferred gains on business sold through reinsurance.  Effective October 1, 2021, we entered into a reinsurance \\nagreement with Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Resolution Life that we refer to herein as “Resolution \\nLife”).  We are recognizing the gain related to this transaction over the projected life of the policies, or 30 years.  Effective January 1, \\n2020, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc (“Swiss Re”).  We are recognizing the gain \\nrelated to this transaction over the period in which the in-force policies are expected to run off, or 15 years.  Effective October 1, 2018, \\nwe entered into a reinsurance agreement with Athene Holding Ltd. (“Athene”).  We are recognizing the gain related to this transaction \\nover the period in which the majority of account values is expected to run off, or 20 years.  See Note 8 for additional information.\\n \\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities\\n \\nSeparate accounts represent segregated funds that are maintained to meet speciﬁc investment objectives of contract holders who direct \\nthe investments and bear the investment risk, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain \\naccounts.  The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the \\nCompany.\\n \\nWe report separate account assets as a summary total on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the fair value of the underlying \\ninvestments.  The underlying investments consist primarily of mutual funds, ﬁxed maturity AFS securities, short-term investments and \\ncash.  Investment income and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) of the separate accounts generally accrue directly to the contract \\nholders; therefore, they are not reﬂected on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), and the Consolidated \\nStatements of Cash Flows do not reﬂect investment activity of the separate accounts.  Asset-based fees and contract administration \\ncharges are assessed against the accounts and included within fee income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \\n(Loss).  An amount equivalent to the separate account assets is recorded as separate account liabilities, representing the account balance \\nobligated to be returned to the contract holder.\\n \\nFuture Contract Beneﬁts \\n \\nFuture contract beneﬁts represent liability reserves that we have established and carry based on estimates of how much we will need to \\npay for future beneﬁts and claims.  We continually review overall reserve position, reserving techniques and reinsurance arrangements.  \\nAs experience develops and new information becomes known, liabilities are adjusted as deemed necessary.   \\n \\nThe liabilities for future insurance contract beneﬁts and claim reserves for traditional life policies are computed using assumptions for \\ninvestment yields, mortality rates and withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial methods and assumptions at the \\ntime of contract issue.  Investment yield assumptions for traditional direct individual life reserves for all contracts range from 2.25% to \\n7.75% depending on the time of contract issue.  The liabilities for future contract beneﬁts and claims reserves for immediate and \\ndeferred paid-up annuities are computed using investment yield assumptions that range from 0.50% to 12.15%.  These investment yield \\nassumptions are intended to represent an estimation of the interest rate experience for the period that these contract beneﬁts are payable.\\n\\xa0\\nThe liability for future claim reserves for long-term disability contracts for incurred and reported claims are calculated based on \\nassumptions as to interest, claim resolution rates and offsets for other insurance including social security.  Claim resolution rate \\nassumptions and social security offsets are based on our actual experience.  The interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim \\nreserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults and investment expenses, for assets supporting the \\nliabilities.  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and reserving models used \\nin calculating these reserves.  The incurred but not reported claim reserves are based on our experiences as to the reporting lags and \\nultimate loss experience.  Claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting \\nclaim experience change.  Claim reserves do not include a provision for adverse deviation. \\n \\nThe business written or assumed by us includes participating life insurance contracts, under which the contract holder is entitled to \\nshare in the earnings of such contracts via receipt of dividends.

The \\nliabilities for these guarantees are calculated by estimating the present value of total expected beneﬁt payments over the life of the \\ncontract from inception divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract (“beneﬁt ratio”) \\nmultiplied by the cumulative assessments recorded from the contract inception through the balance sheet date less the cumulative \\npayments plus interest on the liability.  The change in the liability for a period is the beneﬁt ratio multiplied by the assessments recorded \\nfor the period less payments made in the period plus interest.  As experience or assumption changes result in a change in expected \\nbeneﬁt payments or assessments, the beneﬁt ratio is unlocked or, in other words, recalculated using the updated expected beneﬁt \\npayments and assessments over the life of the contract since inception.  The revised beneﬁt ratio is then applied to the liability \\ncalculation described above, with the resulting change in liability reported in beneﬁts on the Consolidated Statements of \\nComprehensive Income (Loss).  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and \\nprojection models used in estimating these reserves and unlock assumptions similar to the DAC discussion above.  We may have \\nunlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our comprehensive \\nreview.  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling reﬁnements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying value \\nof these reserves.  The change in liability impacts EGPs used to calculate amortization of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.\\n \\nCertain of our variable annuity contracts reported within future contract beneﬁts contain GLB reserves embedded derivatives, a portion \\nof which may be reported in either other assets or other liabilities, and include guaranteed interest and similar contracts, that are carried \\nat fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents approximate exit price including an estimate for our NPR.  Certain \\nof these features have elements of both insurance beneﬁts and embedded derivatives.  Through our hybrid accounting approach, for \\nreserve calculation purposes we assign product cash ﬂows to the embedded derivative or insurance portion of the reserves based on the \\nlife-contingent nature of the beneﬁts.  We report the insurance portion of the reserves in future contract beneﬁts.  We classify these GLB \\nreserves embedded derivatives items in Level 3 within the hierarchy levels described above in “Fair Value Measurement.”  The “market \\nconsistent scenarios” used in\\xa0the determination of the fair value of the GLB liability are\\xa0similar\\xa0to those used by an investment bank to \\nvalue derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  We use risk-neutral Monte Carlo \\nsimulations in our calculation to value the entire block of guarantees, which involve 100 unique scenarios per policy or approximately \\n44\\xa0million scenarios.  The market consistent scenario assumptions, as of each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a \\nhypothetical market participant.  The market consistent inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions for capital markets (e.g., \\nimplied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, rider utilization, \\netc.), mortality rates, risk margins, maintenance expenses and a margin for proﬁt.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with \\nthose that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  \\nIt is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  As \\ndiscussed in Note 5, we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the \\nembedded derivatives for living beneﬁts in certain of our variable annuity products.  The change in fair value of these instruments tends \\nto move in the opposite direction of the change in the value of the associated reserves.  The net impact of these changes is reported as a \\ncomponent of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\\n \\nOther Contract Holder Funds\\n \\nOther contract holder funds includes account values on UL and VUL insurance and investment-type annuity products where account \\nvalues are equal to deposits plus interest credited less withdrawals, surrender charges, asset-based fees and contract administration \\ncharges, as well as amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our IUL and indexed \\nannuity products.  During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection \\nmodels used in estimating these embedded derivatives and unlock assumptions similar to the DAC discussion above.  We may have \\nunlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our comprehensive \\nreview.  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling reﬁnements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying value \\nof these embedded derivatives.  Other contract holder funds also includes DFEL (see “DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI” above), dividends \\npayable to contract holders and undistributed earnings on participating business.\\n \\nShort-Term and Long-Term Debt\\n \\nShort-term debt has contractual or expected maturities of one year or less.  Long-term debt has contractual or expected maturities \\ngreater than one year.\\n \\nPayables for Collateral on Investments\\n \\nWhen we enter into collateralized ﬁnancing transactions on our investments, a liability is recorded equal to the cash or non-cash \\ncollateral received.  This liability is included within payables for collateral on investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Income \\nand expenses associated with these transactions are recorded as investment income and investment expenses within net investment \\nincome on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Changes in payables for collateral on investments are \\nreﬂected within cash ﬂows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n \\n12330/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 201/32430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 202/324Table of Contents\\n \\nContingencies and Commitments\\n \\nA loss contingency is an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will \\nultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  Contingencies arising from environmental remediation \\ncosts, regulatory judgments, claims, assessments, guarantees, litigation, recourse reserves, ﬁnes, penalties and other sources are \\nrecorded when deemed probable and reasonably estimable, based on our best estimate.\\n \\nFee Income\\n \\nFee income for investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts consists of asset-based fees, percent of premium charges, \\ncontract administration charges and surrender charges that are assessed against contract holder account values.  Investment products \\nconsist primarily of individual and group variable and ﬁxed annuities.  Interest-sensitive life insurance products include UL, VUL, \\nlinked-beneﬁt UL and VUL and other interest-sensitive life insurance policies.  These products include life insurance sold to \\nindividuals, corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance.  \\n \\nIn bifurcating the embedded derivative of our GLB features on our variable annuity products, we attribute to the embedded derivative \\nthe portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relate to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”), which are not reported \\nwithin fee income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  These attributed fees represent the present value \\nof future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract plus a margin that a theoretical market participant \\nwould include for risk/proﬁt and are reported within realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \\n(Loss).\\n \\nThe timing of revenue recognition as it relates to fees assessed on investment contracts is determined based on the nature of such fees.  \\nAsset-based fees and contract administration charges are assessed on a daily or monthly basis and recognized as revenue as \\nperformance obligations are met, over the period underlying customer assets are owned or advisory services are provided.  Percent of \\npremium charges are assessed at the time of premium payment and recognized as revenue when assessed and earned.  Certain amounts \\nassessed that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods are reported as unearned revenue and recognized in \\nincome over the periods beneﬁted.  Surrender charges are recognized upon surrender of a contract by the contract holder in accordance \\nwith contractual terms.  For investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, the amounts collected from contract holders are \\nconsidered deposits and are not included in revenue.  \\n \\nWholesaling-related 12b-1 fees received from separate account fund sponsors as compensation for servicing the underlying mutual \\nfunds are recorded as revenues based on a contractual percentage of the market value of mutual fund assets over the period shares are \\nowned by customers.  Net investment advisory fees related to asset management of certain separate account funds are recorded as \\nrevenues based on a contractual percentage of the customer’s managed assets over the period advisory services are provided.  Fee \\nincome related to 12b-1 fees and net investment advisory fees, reported primarily within our Annuities segment, was $743 million, \\n$848 million and $732 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n \\nInsurance Premiums\\n \\nInsurance premiums consist primarily of group insurance products, traditional life insurance and payout annuities with life \\ncontingencies.  These premiums are recognized as revenue when due.\\n \\nNet Investment Income\\n \\nWe earn investment income on the underlying general account investments supporting our ﬁxed products less related expenses.  \\nDividends and interest income, recorded in net investment income, are recognized when earned.  Amortization of premiums and \\naccretion of discounts on investments in debt securities are reﬂected in net investment income over the contractual terms of the \\ninvestments in a manner that produces a constant effective yield.  \\n \\nFor CLOs and MBS, included in the trading and ﬁxed maturity AFS securities portfolios, we recognize income using a constant \\neffective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities.\\xa0 When actual prepayments differ \\nsigniﬁcantly from originally anticipated prepayments,\\xa0the\\xa0retrospective effective yield is recalculated to reﬂect actual payments to \\ndate\\xa0and\\xa0a catch up adjustment is recorded in the current period.\\xa0 In addition,\\xa0the new\\xa0effective yield, which reﬂects anticipated future \\npayments, is\\xa0used\\xa0prospectively.\\xa0 Any adjustments resulting from changes in effective yield are reﬂected in net investment income on \\nthe Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\\n \\nRealized Gain (Loss)\\n \\nRealized gain (loss) includes realized gains and losses from the sale of investments, write-downs for impairments of investments and \\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses for ﬁnancial assets, changes in fair value of mortgage loans on real estate accounted for under \\nthe fair value option, changes in fair value of equity securities, certain derivative and embedded derivative gains and losses, gains and \\nlosses on the sale of subsidiaries and businesses and net gains and losses on reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and trading \\nsecurities.

The \\nbroker-dealer services primarily relate to our retail sales network and consist of commission revenue for the sale of non-afﬁliated \\nsecurities recorded on a trade date basis and advisory fee income.  Advisory fee income is asset-based revenues recorded as earned \\nbased on a contractual percentage of customer account values.  Other revenues attributable to broker-dealer services and advisory fee \\nincome, reported primarily within our Annuities segment, were $584 million, $628 million and $516 million for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Beneﬁts also include the change in reserves for life insurance products with secondary guarantee beneﬁts, \\nannuity products with guaranteed death and living beneﬁts and certain annuities with life contingencies.  For traditional life, group life \\nand disability income products, beneﬁts are recognized when incurred in a manner consistent with the related premium recognition \\npolicies.  \\n \\nSpark Program Expense\\n \\nSpark program expense consists primarily of costs related to our Spark Initiative. \\n \\nPension and Other Postretirement Beneﬁt Plans\\n \\nPursuant to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees and agents under our various pension and other postretirement beneﬁt \\nplans, we are required to make a number of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses.  The mortality assumption is based \\non actual and anticipated plan experience, determined using acceptable actuarial methods.  We use assumptions for the weighted-\\naverage discount rate and expected return on plan assets to estimate pension expense.  The discount rate assumptions are determined \\nusing an analysis of current market information and the projected beneﬁt ﬂows associated with these plans.  The expected long-term \\nrate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected future rates of return on the funds invested in the plan.  The calculation \\nof our accumulated postretirement beneﬁt obligation also uses an assumption of weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per \\ncapita cost of covered beneﬁts, which reﬂects a health care cost trend rate.  \\n \\nStock-Based Compensation\\n \\nIn general, we expense the fair value of stock awards included in our incentive compensation plans.  As of the date our stock awards are \\napproved, the fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes options valuation methodology, and the fair value of other \\nstock awards is based upon the market value of the stock.  The fair value of the awards is expensed over the performance or service \\nperiod, which generally corresponds to the vesting period, and is recognized as an increase to common stock in stockholders’ equity.  \\nWe apply an estimated forfeiture rate to our accrual of compensation cost.  We classify certain stock awards as liabilities.  For these \\nawards, the settlement value is classiﬁed as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liability is marked-to-market through \\nnet income at the end of each reporting period.  Stock-based compensation expense is reﬂected in commissions and other expenses on \\nthe Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). \\n \\nInterest and Debt Expense\\n \\nInterest expense on our short-term and long-term debt is recognized as due and any associated premiums, discounts and debt issuance \\ncosts are amortized (accreted) over the term of the related borrowing utilizing the effective interest method.  In addition, gains or losses \\nrelated to certain derivative instruments associated with debt are recognized in interest and debt expense during the period of the \\nchange.\\n \\nIncome Taxes\\n \\nWe ﬁle a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our eligible subsidiaries.  Ineligible subsidiaries ﬁle separate \\nindividual corporate tax returns.

In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including:  the nature and character of the \\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of temporary differences; the length of time \\ncarryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax beneﬁt from expiring unused. \\n \\nForeign Currency Translation\\n \\nThe balance sheet accounts and income statement items of foreign subsidiaries, reported in functional currencies other than the U.S. \\ndollar are translated at the current and average exchange rates for the year, respectively.  Resulting translation adjustments and other \\ntranslation adjustments for foreign currency transactions that affect cash ﬂows are reported in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ \\nequity.\\n \\nEarnings Per Share\\n \\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the average common shares \\noutstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed assuming the conversion or exercise of non-vested stock, stock options and performance share \\nunits outstanding during the year.  \\n \\nFor any period where a net loss is experienced, shares used in the diluted EPS calculation represent basic shares, as the use of diluted \\nshares would result in a lower loss per share.\\n \\n2.\\xa0\\xa0New Accounting Standards\\n \\nThe following table provides a description of our adoption of new Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) issued by the FASB and \\nthe impact of the adoption on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

Under this ASU, insurers will be \\nrequired to review cash ﬂow assumptions at \\nleast annually and update them if necessary.  \\nThey also will have to make quarterly \\nupdates to the discount rate assumptions \\nthey use to measure the liability for future \\npolicyholder beneﬁts.  The ASU creates a \\nnew category of market risk beneﬁts (i.e., \\nfeatures that protect the contract holder \\nfrom capital market risk and expose the \\ninsurer to that risk) that insurers will have \\nto measure at fair value.  The ASU provides \\nvarious transition methods by topic that \\nentities may elect upon adoption.  The ASU \\nis effective January 1, 2023, and early \\nadoption is permitted.January 1, 2023 We will adopt this ASU effective \\nJanuary 1, 2023, with a transition date of \\nJanuary 1, 2021, using a modiﬁed \\nretrospective approach, except for \\nmarket risk beneﬁts in which we will \\napply a full retrospective transition \\napproach.\\n \\nWe currently estimate that, at the \\ntransition date of January 1, 2021, the \\nadoption of this standard and related \\namendments will result in a decrease to \\npreviously reported stockholders’ equity \\nin an after-tax range of approximately \\n$1.4 billion to $1.9 billion, including a \\ndecrease to previously reported retained \\nearnings in an after-tax range of \\napproximately $6.0 billion to $6.5 \\nbillion, and an increase to previously \\nreported AOCI in an after-tax range of \\napproximately $4.4 billion to $4.9 \\nbillion.                                                            \\n \\nThe remeasurement of certain current \\nbeneﬁts (e.g., guaranteed death beneﬁts \\non variable annuities) to fair valued \\nmarket risk beneﬁts, excluding the \\nportion attributable to NPR, is expected \\nto have the most signiﬁcant impact to \\nretained earnings. \\n \\nThe most signiﬁcant drivers of the \\ncumulative adjustment to AOCI are \\nexpected to be the NPR associated with \\nthe fair valued market risk beneﬁts, the \\nelimination of DAC and DAC-like \\nintangible balances recorded in AOCI \\nrelated to changes in unrealized gains \\nand losses on investments, and the \\nchanges in the discount rate assumption \\nsince the inception of the contracts to \\nreﬂect the changes in the upper-medium-\\ngrade ﬁxed-income instrument (single-\\nA) interest rate for the liability for future \\npolicy beneﬁts associated with certain \\nlong-duration contracts.        \\n \\nThe effect this standard adoption has on \\nstockholders’ equity will be impacted by \\neconomic conditions, including \\nﬂuctuations in both the capital markets \\nand interest rates, as well as certain \\nactuarial assumptions.

Based upon this evaluation as of December\\xa031, 2022, management believes \\nwe have the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g., insurance premiums, fee income and \\ninvestment income) to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our impaired securities. \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 217/324As of December\\xa031, 2022, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond, U.S. government bond, state and municipal bond \\nand foreign government bond securities were attributable primarily to rising interest rates and widening credit spreads since purchase.  \\nWe performed a detailed analysis of the ﬁnancial performance of the underlying issuers and determined that we expected to recover the \\nentire amortized cost of each impaired security.\\n13130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 218/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nCredit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security.  Securities rated investment grade (those rated BBB- or higher by \\nS&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”)) are generally considered by the rating \\nagencies and market participants to be low credit risk.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, 96% of the fair value of our corporate bond \\nportfolio was rated investment grade.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the portion of our corporate bond portfolio rated below \\ninvestment grade had an amortized cost of $3.7\\xa0billion, and a fair value of $3.5\\xa0billion and $3.8\\xa0billion, respectively.  Based upon the \\nanalysis discussed above, we believe that as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, we would have recovered the amortized cost of each \\ncorporate bond.\\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the unrealized losses associated with our MBS and ABS were attributable primarily to rising interest rates \\nand widening credit spreads since purchase.  We assessed for credit impairment using a cash ﬂow model that incorporates key \\nassumptions including default rates, severities and prepayment rates.  We estimated losses for a security by forecasting the underlying \\nloans in each transaction.  The forecasted loan performance was used to project cash ﬂows to the various tranches in the structure, as \\napplicable.  Our forecasted cash ﬂows also considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts and other \\nindependent market data.  Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the performance of the \\nunderlying collateral compared to our subordination or other credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of \\neach impaired security.\\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the unrealized losses associated with our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities were attributable \\nprimarily to wider credit spreads caused by illiquidity in the market and subordination within the capital structure, as well as credit risk \\nof underlying issuers.  For our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities, we evaluated the ﬁnancial performance of the underlying \\nissuers based upon credit performance and investment ratings and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of \\neach impaired security.\\n \\nCredit Loss Impairment on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities\\n \\nWe regularly review our ﬁxed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related, including \\nthose attributable to credit risk factors that may require an allowance for credit losses.

Derivative Instruments\\n\\xa0\\nWe maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize signiﬁcant unplanned \\nﬂuctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, basis risk, commodity \\nrisk and credit risk.  We assess these risks by continually identifying and monitoring changes in our exposures that may adversely affect \\nexpected future cash ﬂows and by evaluating hedging opportunities.  \\n \\nDerivative activities are monitored by various management committees.  The committees are responsible for overseeing the \\nimplementation of various hedging strategies that are developed through the analysis of ﬁnancial simulation models and other internal \\nand industry sources.  The resulting hedging strategies are incorporated into our overall risk management strategies.    \\n \\nSee Note 1 for a detailed discussion of the accounting treatment for derivative instruments.  See Note 20 for additional disclosures \\nrelated to the fair value of our derivative instruments and Note 3 for derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs.30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 229/324 \\n13830/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 230/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nInterest Rate Contracts\\n \\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.  These instruments are economic hedges unless \\notherwise noted and include:\\n \\nForward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps\\n \\nWe use forward-starting interest rate swaps designated and qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nﬂuctuations related to the forecasted purchases of certain assets and anticipated issuances of ﬁxed-rate securities.  \\n \\nWe also use forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure within our life and annuity products.\\n \\nInterest Rate Cap Corridors\\n \\nWe use interest rate cap corridors to provide a level of protection from the effect of rising interest rates for certain life insurance \\nproducts and annuity contracts.  Interest rate cap corridors involve purchasing an interest rate cap at a speciﬁc cap rate and selling an \\ninterest rate cap with a higher cap rate.  For each corridor, the amount of quarterly payments, if any, is determined by the rate at which \\nthe underlying index rate resets above the original capped rate.  The corridor limits the beneﬁt the purchaser can receive as the related \\ninterest rate index rises above the higher capped rate.  There is no additional liability to us other than the purchase price associated with \\nthe interest rate cap corridor. \\n \\nInterest Rate Futures\\n \\nWe use interest rate futures contracts to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  These futures \\ncontracts require payment between our counterparty and us on a daily basis for changes in the futures index price.\\n \\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\\n \\nWe use interest rate swap agreements to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.\\n \\nWe also use interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges to hedge the interest rate risk of ﬂoating-rate \\nbond coupon payments by replicating a ﬁxed-rate bond. \\n \\nFinally, we use interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as fair value hedges to hedge against changes in the fair value \\nof certain ﬁxed-rate long-term debt and ﬁxed maturity securities due to interest rate risks. \\n \\nTreasury and Reverse Treasury Locks\\n \\nWe use treasury locks designated and qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our issuance of ﬁxed-\\nrate securities or the anticipated future cash ﬂows of ﬂoating-rate ﬁxed maturity securities due to changes in interest rates.  In addition, \\nwe use reverse treasury locks designated and qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the \\nanticipated purchase of ﬁxed-rate securities or the anticipated future cash ﬂows of ﬂoating-rate ﬁxed maturity securities due to changes \\nin interest rates.  These derivatives are primarily structured to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain \\nliabilities.  \\n \\nForeign Currency Contracts\\n \\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our foreign currency risk management strategy.  These instruments are economic hedges unless \\notherwise noted and include:  \\n \\nCurrency Futures\\n \\nWe use currency futures to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with certain options in variable annuity products.  Currency futures \\nexchange one currency for another at a speciﬁed date in the future at a speciﬁed exchange rate. \\n \\nForeign Currency Swaps\\n \\nWe use foreign currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in ﬁxed maturity securities denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies.  A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange one currency for another at speciﬁed dates in the future at a \\nspeciﬁed exchange rate. \\n \\nWe also use foreign currency swaps designated and qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in \\nﬁxed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies. \\n 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 231/32413930/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 232/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nForeign Currency Forwards \\n \\nWe use foreign currency forwards to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in ﬁxed maturity securities denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies.  A foreign currency forward is a contractual agreement to exchange one currency for another at speciﬁed dates in the future \\nat a speciﬁed current exchange rate.\\n \\nEquity Market Contracts\\n \\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our equity market risk management strategy that are economic hedges and include:  \\n \\nCall Options Based on the S&P 500® Index and Other Indices\\n \\nWe use call options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity, indexed variable annuity, ﬁxed indexed \\nannuity, IUL and VUL products.\\n \\nOur indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component, where interest \\ncredited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index or other indices.  Contract holders may elect to rebalance \\nindex options at renewal dates.  At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the \\nindexed component by establishing participation rates, caps, spreads and speciﬁed rates, subject to contractual guarantees.  We use call \\noptions that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged \\nwith respect to equity returns for the current reset period.  \\n \\nConsumer Price Index Swaps\\n \\nWe use consumer price index swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in ﬁxed annuity products.  Consumer price index \\nswaps are contracts entered into at no cost and whose payoff is the difference between the consumer price index inﬂation rate and the \\nﬁxed-rate determined as of inception.\\n \\nEquity Futures\\n \\nWe use equity futures contracts to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  These futures contracts \\nrequire payment between our counterparty and us on a daily basis for changes in the futures index price.\\n \\nPut Options\\n \\nWe use put options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity, indexed variable annuity and VUL products.  \\nPut options are contracts that require counterparties to pay us at a speciﬁed future date the amount, if any, by which a speciﬁed equity \\nindex is less than the strike rate stated in the agreement, applied to a notional amount.\\n \\nTotal Return Swaps\\n \\nWe use total return swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products and indexed variable annuity \\nproducts. \\n \\nIn addition, we use total return swaps to hedge a portion of the liability related to our deferred compensation plans.  We receive the total \\nreturn on a portfolio of indexes and pay a ﬂoating-rate of interest.  \\n \\nCommodity Contracts \\n \\nWe use commodity contracts to economically hedge certain investments that are closely tied to the changes in commodity values.  The \\ncommodity contract is an over-the-counter contract that combines a purchase put/sold call to lock in a commodity price within a \\npredetermined range in exchange for a net premium.\\n \\nCredit Contracts\\n \\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our credit risk management strategy that are economic hedges and include:  \\n \\nCredit Default Swaps – Buying Protection\\n \\nWe use credit default swaps (“CDSs”) to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. \\n \\nWe buy CDSs to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers.  A CDS allows us to put the bond \\nback to the counterparty at par upon a default event by the bond issuer.  A default event is deﬁned as bankruptcy, failure to pay, \\nobligation acceleration or restructuring. 30/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 233/32414030/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 234/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nCDSs – Selling Protection\\n \\nWe use CDSs to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. \\n \\nWe sell CDSs to offer credit protection to contract holders and investors.  The CDSs hedge the contract holders and investors against a \\ndrop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers.  A CDS allows the investor to put the bond back to us at par upon a \\ndefault event by the bond issuer.  A default event is deﬁned as bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation acceleration or restructuring.  \\n \\nEmbedded Derivatives\\n \\nWe have embedded derivatives that include:\\n \\nGLB Reserves Embedded Derivatives\\n \\nCertain features of these guarantees have elements of both insurance beneﬁts accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – \\nClaim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Beneﬁts Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“beneﬁt reserves”) and embedded derivatives \\naccounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC \\n(“embedded derivative reserves”).  We calculate the value of the beneﬁt reserves and the embedded derivative reserves based on the \\nspeciﬁc characteristics of each GLB feature. \\n \\nWe use a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, \\ninterest rates and volatility associated with GLBs offered in our variable annuity products, including products with GWB and GIB \\nfeatures.  Changes in the value of the hedge contracts due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities hedge the \\nincome statement effect of changes in embedded derivative GLB reserves caused by those same factors.  We rebalance our hedge \\npositions based upon changes in these factors as needed.  While we actively manage our hedge positions, these hedge positions may not \\nbe totally effective in offsetting changes in the embedded derivative reserve due to, among other things, differences in timing between \\nwhen a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets and interest \\nrates, market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, \\ndivergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments and our ability to purchase hedging instruments at \\nprices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off.   \\n \\nIndexed Annuity and IUL Contracts Embedded Derivatives\\n \\nOur indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component, where interest \\ncredited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500® Index or other indices.  Contract holders may elect to rebalance \\nindex options at renewal dates.  At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the \\nindexed component by establishing participation rates, caps, spreads and speciﬁed rates, subject to contractual guarantees.  We use \\noptions that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged \\nwith respect to equity returns for the current reset period. \\n \\nReinsurance-Related Embedded Derivatives\\n \\nWe have certain modiﬁed coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements with embedded derivatives related \\nto the withheld assets of the related funds.  These derivatives are considered total return swaps with contractual returns that are \\nattributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements. \\n \\n14130/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 235/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nWe have derivative instruments with off-balance-sheet risks whose notional or contract amounts exceed the related credit exposure.  \\nOutstanding derivative instruments with off-balance-sheet risks (in millions) were as follows:\\n \\n \\n                   \\n                   \\n As of December 31, 2022  As of December 31, 2021  \\n Notional  Fair Value  Notional  Fair Value  \\n Amounts Asset  Liability Amounts Asset  Liability \\nQualifying Hedges                   \\nCash ﬂow hedges:                   \\nInterest rate contracts (1)$  2,590 $  123 $  232 $  3,222 $  98 $  436 \\nForeign currency contracts (1)  4,383   643   18   3,979   283   51 \\nTotal cash ﬂow hedges   6,973   766   250   7,201   381   487 \\nFair value hedges:                   \\nInterest rate contracts (1)  1,155   2   44   1,157   -

This reclassiﬁcation would be due primarily to interest rate variances related to our \\ninterest rate swap agreements.\\n \\nFor the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, there were no material reclassiﬁcations to earnings due to hedged ﬁrm commitments \\nno longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally speciﬁed time \\nperiod.\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any exposure related to CDSs for which we are the seller.\\n \\nCredit Risk\\n \\nWe are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts and reﬂect \\nassumptions regarding the credit or NPR.  The NPR is based upon assumptions for each counterparty’s credit spread over the estimated \\nweighted average life of the counterparty exposure, less collateral held.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, the NPR adjustment was zero.  The \\ncredit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by entering into agreements with ﬁnancial institutions with long-standing, \\nsuperior performance records.  Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring derivative contracts to be governed by an International \\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement.  We are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine \\npractice in negotiating ISDA agreements.  Under some ISDA agreements, our insurance subsidiaries have agreed to maintain certain \\nﬁnancial strength or claims-paying ratings.  A downgrade below these levels could result in termination of derivative contracts, at which \\ntime any amounts payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts.  In certain transactions, \\nwe and the counterparty have entered into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral when net exposures exceed \\npre-determined thresholds.  These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating.  The amount of such exposure is essentially the net \\nreplacement cost or market value less collateral held for such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor.  \\nWe did not have any exposure as of December\\xa031, 2022 or 2021. \\n \\n14530/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 240/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe amounts recognized (in millions) by S&P credit rating of counterparty, for which we had the right to reclaim cash collateral or were \\nobligated to return cash collateral, were as follows:\\n \\n \\n              \\n              \\n  As of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021 \\n  Collateral  Collateral  Collateral  Collateral  \\n  Posted by Posted by Posted by Posted by \\nS&P  Counter- LNC  Counter- LNC  \\nCredit  Party (Held by Party (Held by \\nRating of  (Held by Counter- (Held by Counter- \\nCounterparty  LNC) Party) LNC)  Party) \\nAA-  $  383 $  (6)$  2,346 $  (281)\\nA+    1,718   (166)  2,772   (251)\\nA    1,172   -   456   (189)\\n  $  3,273 $  (172)$  5,574 $  (721)\\n \\nBalance Sheet Offsetting\\n \\nInformation related to the effects of offsetting on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions) was as follows:  \\n \\n              \\n             \\n  As of December 31, 2022  \\n      Embedded    \\n  Derivative  Derivative    \\n  Instruments  Instruments Total \\n             \\nFinancial Assets             \\nGross amount of recognized assets  $  6,099  $  2,667  $  8,766 \\nGross amounts offset    (2,506)   -    (2,506)\\nNet amount of assets (1)   3,593    2,667    6,260 \\nGross amounts not offset:             \\nCash collateral    (3,273)   -    (3,273)\\nNon-cash collateral (2)   (320)   -    (320)\\nNet amount  $  -  $  2,667  $  2,667 \\n             \\nFinancial Liabilities             \\nGross amount of recognized liabilities $  256  $  4,950  $  5,206 \\nGross amounts offset    (47)   -    (47)\\nNet amount of liabilities    209    4,950    5,159 \\nGross amounts not offset:             \\nCash collateral    (172)   -    (172)\\nNon-cash collateral (2)   (37)   -    (37)\\nNet amount  $  -  $  4,950  $  4,950 \\n             \\n \\n(1)Includes a net deferred premium payable of $143 million, the components of which are reported in other assets and other liabilities \\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n(2)Excludes excess non-cash collateral received of $1.1 billion and excess non-cash collateral pledged of $9 million, as the collateral \\noffset is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting arrangements.\\n \\n14630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 241/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\n              \\n             \\n  As of December 31, 2021  \\n      Embedded    \\n  Derivative  Derivative    \\n  Instruments  Instruments Total \\nFinancial Assets             \\nGross amount of recognized assets  $  7,938  $  2,547  $  10,485 \\nGross amounts offset    (2,241)   -    (2,241)\\nNet amount of assets (1)   5,697    2,547    8,244 \\nGross amounts not offset:             \\nCash collateral (2)   (5,574)   -    (5,574)\\nNon-cash collateral (3)   (123)   -    (123)\\nNet amount  $  -  $  2,547  $  2,547 \\n             \\nFinancial Liabilities             \\nGross amount of recognized liabilities $  777  $  6,519  $  7,296 \\nGross amounts offset    (68)   -    (68)\\nNet amount of liabilities    709    6,519    7,228 \\nGross amounts not offset:             \\nCash collateral (2)   (709)   -    (709)\\nNon-cash collateral (3)   -    -    - \\nNet amount  $  -  $  6,519  $  6,519 \\n \\n(1)Includes a net deferred premium receivable of $260 million, the components of which are reported in other assets and other \\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n(2)Excludes excess cash collateral pledged of $12 million, as the cash collateral offset is limited to the net estimated fair value of \\nderivatives after application of netting arrangements.\\n(3)Excludes excess non-cash collateral received of $410 million and excess non-cash collateral pledged of $292 million, as the \\ncollateral offset is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting arrangements.\\n \\n6.

Protective has funded trusts, of which the balance in the trusts changes as a \\nresult of ongoing reinsurance activity, to support the business ceded, which totaled $11.5 billion and $14.0 billion as of December 31, \\n2022 and 2021, respectively.  \\n \\nEffective October 1, 2021, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Resolution Life to reinsure liabilities under a block of in-force \\nexecutive beneﬁt and universal life policies.  The agreement is structured as coinsurance for the general account reserves and modiﬁed \\ncoinsurance for the separate account reserves.  Amounts recoverable from Resolution Life were $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 \\nand 2021.  Resolution Life has funded trusts, the balances of which change as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity to support the \\nbusiness ceded, that totaled $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  As described in Note 1, we recorded a deferred gain on \\nbusiness sold through reinsurance and amortized $40 million and $10 million of the gain during 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n \\nSome portions of our annuity business have been reinsured on a modiﬁed coinsurance basis with other companies.  In a modiﬁed \\ncoinsurance agreement, we as the ceding company retain the reserves, as well as the assets backing those reserves, and the reinsurer \\nshares proportionally in all ﬁnancial terms of the reinsured policies based on their respective percentage of the risk.  \\n \\nEffective October 1, 2018, we entered into one such modiﬁed coinsurance agreement with Athene to reinsure ﬁxed annuity products, \\nwhich resulted in a deposit asset of $3.8 billion and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, within other assets on \\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \\n \\nWe held assets in support of reserves associated with the Athene transaction in a modiﬁed coinsurance investment portfolio, which \\nconsisted of the following (in millions):\\n           \\n    \\n  As of December 31,   \\n 2022 2021  \\nFixed maturity AFS securities  $  474  $  744  \\nTrading securities    2,644    3,399  \\nEquity securities    60    54  \\nMortgage loans on real estate    487    739  \\nDerivative investments    39    93  \\nOther investments    42    227  \\nCash and invested cash    26    110  \\nAccrued investment income    35    33  \\nOther assets    2    5  \\nTotal  $  3,809  $  5,404  \\n          \\nThe portfolio was supported by $105 million of over-collateralization and a $117 million letter of credit as of December 31, 2022.  \\nAdditionally, we recorded a deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance related to the transaction with Athene and amortized \\n$25 million, $26 million and $29 million of the gain during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  \\n \\nSee “Realized Gain (Loss)” in Note 15 for information on reinsurance-related embedded derivatives.\\n \\nOur reinsurance operations were acquired by Swiss Re in December 2001 through a series of indemnity reinsurance transactions.  As \\nsuch, Swiss Re reinsured certain liabilities and obligations under the indemnity reinsurance agreements.  As we are not relieved of our \\nliability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on the \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re, which totaled $1.1 billion as of December \\n31, 2022 and 2021.  Swiss Re has funded a trust, with a balance of $710 million and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively, to support this business.  In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we \\ncontinue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves.  These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and \\ncertain mortgage loans.  \\n \\nCredit Losses on Reinsurance-Related Assets\\n \\nIn connection with our recognition of an allowance for credit losses for reinsurance-related assets, we perform a quantitative analysis \\nusing a probability of loss approach to estimate expected credit losses for reinsurance recoverables, inclusive of similar assets \\nrecognized using the deposit method of accounting.  Our allowance for credit losses was $316 million and $190 million as of December \\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In return, LNC pays a semi-annual facility fee to the trust at a rate of \\n1.691% per year (applied to the unexercised portion of the maximum amount of senior notes that LNC could issue and sell to the trust), \\nand LNC reimburses the trust for its expenses.   \\n \\nThe issuance right will be exercised automatically in full upon our failure to make certain payments to the trust, such as paying the \\nfacility fee or reimbursing the trust for its expenses, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or upon certain bankruptcy events \\ninvolving LNC.  We are also required to exercise the issuance right in full if our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI) \\nfalls below a minimum threshold (which was $2.75 billion as of December 31, 2022, and is subject to adjustment from time to time in \\ncertain cases) and upon certain other events described in the facility agreement.\\n \\nPrior to any involuntary exercise of the issuance right, LNC has the right to repurchase any or all of the 2.330% senior notes then held \\nby the trust in exchange for U.S. Treasury securities.  LNC may redeem any outstanding 2.330% senior notes, in whole or in part, prior \\nto their maturity.  Prior to May 15, 2030, the redemption price will equal the greater of par or a make-whole redemption price.  After \\nMay 15, 2030, any outstanding 2.330% senior notes may be redeemed at par.\\n15630/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 257/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nCredit Facilities \\n \\nCredit facilities, which allow for borrowing or issuances of letters of credit (“LOCs”), (in millions) were as follows:\\n \\n \\n         \\n         \\n   As of December 31, 2022 \\n Expiration  Maximum LOCs \\n Date  Available Issued \\nCredit Facilities         \\nFive-year revolving credit facility June 19, 2026 $  2,500 $  1,641 \\nLOC facility (1)August 26, \\n2031    979   948 \\nLOC facility (1)October 1, 2031   891   891 \\nTotal   $  4,370 $  3,480 \\n \\n(1)Our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into irrevocable LOC facility agreements with third-party lenders supporting inter-\\ncompany reinsurance agreements.\\n \\nDuring June\\xa02021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which amended and restated \\nour existing ﬁve-year revolving credit facility agreement.  The credit facility, which is unsecured, allows for the issuance of LOCs and \\nborrowing of up to $2.5\\xa0billion and has a commitment termination date of June 19, 2026.

For more information about reinsurance, see Note 8.\\n \\nRegulatory and Litigation Matters\\n \\nRegulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other regulatory bodies \\nregularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance \\nlaws, securities laws, laws governing the activities of broker-dealers, registered investment advisers and unclaimed property laws.\\n \\nLNC is involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the \\nconduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise.  In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, \\nincluding punitive and treble damages, are sought.  Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion \\nof monetary damages or other relief.  Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit \\nclaimants to state only that the amount sought is sufﬁcient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court.  In addition, jurisdictions may \\npermit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding verdicts obtained in the jurisdiction for similar matters.  This \\nvariability in pleadings, together with the actual experiences of LNC in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over \\nan extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be speciﬁed in a lawsuit or claim bears \\nlittle relevance to its merits or disposition value.\\n \\nDue to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular \\npoints in time is normally difﬁcult to ascertain.  Uncertainties can include how fact ﬁnders will evaluate documentary evidence and the \\ncredibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings \\nor evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.  Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of \\nhow opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law.\\n \\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  It is possible that some matters \\ncould require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated as of \\nDecember 31, 2022.  \\n \\nFor some matters, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss.  For such matters in which a loss is probable, an \\naccrual has been made.  For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been \\nmade.  Accordingly, the estimate contained in this paragraph reﬂects two types of matters.  For some matters included within this \\nestimate, an accrual has been made, but there is a reasonable possibility that an exposure exists in excess of the amount accrued.  In \\nthese cases, the estimate reﬂects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount.  For other matters included \\nwithin this estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss, while potentially estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible but \\nnot probable.  In these cases, the estimate reﬂects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  As of December 31, 2022, we estimate \\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, including amounts in excess of amounts accrued for these matters as of such date, to \\nbe up to approximately $190 million, after-tax.  Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the Company’s \\nmaximum possible loss exposure on such matters.\\n \\nFor other matters, we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  We are often unable to estimate \\nthe possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufﬁcient information to support an assessment of \\nthe range of possible loss, such as quantiﬁcation of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of \\nfactual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement negotiations.  On a \\nquarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures \\nand estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.\\n \\nAmong other matters, we are presently engaged in litigation, including relating to cost of insurance rates (“Cost of Insurance and Other \\nLitigation”), as described below.  No accrual has been made for some of these matters.  Although a loss is believed to be reasonably \\npossible for these matters, for some of these matters, we are not able to estimate a reasonably possible amount or range of potential \\nliability.  An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters may have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, but, \\nbased on information currently known, management does not believe those cases are likely to have such an impact.\\n \\nCost of Insurance and Other Litigation \\n \\nCost of Insurance Litigation\\n \\nGlover v.

Also, the state of New York \\nprescribes use of the continuous Commissioners’ Annuity Reserve Valuation Method in the calculation of reserves and use of minimum \\nreserve methods and assumptions for variable annuity and individual life insurance contracts that may be more conservative than those \\nrequired by NAIC SAP.\\xa0 The statutory permitted practices allow accounting for certain derivative assets at amortized cost and allow \\ndetermining certain indexed annuity and indexed universal life statutory reserve calculations with the assumption that the market value \\nof the related liability call option(s) associated with the current index term is zero.  At the conclusion of the index term, credited interest \\nis reﬂected in the reserve as realized, based on actual index performance.  The statutory accounting practices also allow accounting for \\ncertain group ﬁxed annuity assets at general account values.\\n \\nThe Vermont reinsurance subsidiaries also have certain accounting practices permitted by the state of Vermont that differ from those \\nfound in NAIC SAP.

Another permitted practice involves the acquisition of an LLC note in \\nexchange for a variable value surplus note that is recognized as an admitted asset and a form of surplus as of December\\xa031, 2022 and \\n2021.  Lastly, the state of Vermont has permitted a practice to account for certain excess of loss reinsurance agreements with \\nunafﬁliated reinsurers as an asset and form of surplus as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021.

Under RBC \\nrequirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as deﬁned by the NAIC, to its \\ncompany action level of RBC (known as the “RBC ratio”), also as deﬁned by the NAIC.  The company action level may be triggered if \\nthe RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, which would require the insurer to submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it \\nproposes to undertake.  As of December\\xa031, 2022, the consolidated RBC ratio for LNC’s statutory insurance companies was in excess \\nof three times the aforementioned company action level RBC.\\n \\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of \\ndividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary \\ninsurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the \\n“Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus and must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such \\ndividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The \\ncurrent statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on ﬁle \\nwith the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed \\nstatutory unassigned surplus.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of \\nthese limits.  LNL’s subsidiary LLANY, a New York-domiciled insurance company, is bound by similar restrictions under the laws of \\nNew York.

Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions used to \\nmeasure fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-\\ntime, current market exchange of all of our ﬁnancial instruments. \\n \\nMortgage Loans on Real Estate\\n \\nThe fair value of mortgage loans on real estate, excluding mortgage loans accounted for using the fair value option, is established using \\na discounted cash ﬂow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.  The ratings for mortgages in good standing are \\nbased on property type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt-service coverage, loan-to-value, quality of tenancy, borrower and \\npayment record.  The fair value for impaired mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash ﬂows discounted at \\nthe loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The inputs \\nused to measure the fair value of our mortgage loans on real estate, excluding mortgage loans accounted for using the fair value option, \\nare classiﬁed as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. \\n \\nOther Investments\\n \\nThe carrying value of our assets classiﬁed as other investments, excluding short-term investments, approximates fair value.  Other \\ninvestments includes primarily LPs and other privately held investments that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting \\nand the carrying value is based on our proportional share of the net assets of the LPs.  Other investments also includes FHLB stock \\ncarried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.  The inputs used to measure the fair \\nvalue of our LPs, other privately held investments and FHLB stock are classiﬁed as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  The \\nremaining assets in other investments include cash collateral receivables and securities that are not LPs or other privately held \\ninvestments.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets are classiﬁed as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\\n \\nSeparate Account Assets\\n \\nSeparate account assets are primarily carried at fair value.\\xa0 A portion of our separate account assets includes LPs, which are accounted \\nfor using the equity method of accounting.  The carrying value is based on our proportional share of the net assets of the LPs and \\napproximates fair value.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of the separate account asset LPs are classiﬁed as Level 3 within the \\nfair value hierarchy. \\n \\nOther Contract Holder Funds\\n \\nOther contract holder funds include remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts and account values of certain investment \\ncontracts.  The fair value for the remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts is estimated using discounted cash ﬂow \\ncalculations as of the balance sheet date.  These calculations are based on interest rates currently offered on similar contracts with \\nmaturities that are consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.  As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the remaining \\nguaranteed interest and similar contracts carrying value approximated fair value.  The fair value of the account values of certain \\ninvestment contracts is based on their approximate surrender value as of the balance sheet date.  The inputs used to measure the fair \\nvalue of our other contract holder funds are classiﬁed as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\\n \\nShort-Term and Long-Term Debt  \\n \\nThe fair value of short-term and long-term debt is based on quoted market prices.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our \\nshort-term and long-term debt are classiﬁed as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   \\n \\nFair Value Option\\n \\nMortgage loans on real estate, net of allowance for credit losses, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes mortgage \\nloans on real estate for which the fair value option was elected.  The fair value option allows us to elect fair value as an alternative \\nmeasurement for mortgage loans not otherwise reported at fair value.  We have made these elections for certain mortgage loans \\nassociated with modiﬁed coinsurance agreements to help mitigate the inconsistency in earnings that would otherwise result from the \\nuse of embedded derivatives included with these loans.  Changes in fair value are reﬂected in realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated \\nStatement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Changes in fair value due to instrument-speciﬁc credit risk are estimated using changes in \\ncredit spreads and quality ratings for the period reported.  Mortgage loans on real estate for which the fair value option was elected are \\nvalued using third-party pricing services.\\xa0 We have procedures in place to review the valuations each quarter to ensure they are \\nreasonable, including utilizing a separate third party to reperform the valuation for a selection of mortgage loans on an annual basis.  \\nDue to lack of observable inputs, mortgage loans electing the fair value option are classiﬁed as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\\n \\n17430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 284/32430/5/23, 15:53 lnc-20221231x10k\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59558/000005955823000009/lnc-20221231x10k.htm 285/324Table of Contents\\n \\n \\nThe fair value and aggregate contractual principal for mortgage loans on real estate where the fair value option was elected (in millions) \\nwere as follows: \\n \\n \\n        \\n As of December 31,   \\n 2022  2021   \\nFair value $  487 $  739  \\nAggregate contractual principal   514   742  \\n \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, no loans for which the fair value option was elected were in non-accrual status, and none were \\nmore than 90 days past due and still accruing interest. \\n \\nFinancial Instruments Carried at Fair Value\\n \\nWe did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December\\xa031, 2022 or 2021. \\n \\nThe following summarizes our ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value (in millions) on a recurring basis by the fair value hierarchy \\nlevels:\\n \\n \\n  \\n                 \\n                 \\n  As of December 31, 2022  \\n  Quoted             \\n   Prices             \\n  in Active             \\n Markets for Signiﬁcant Signiﬁcant    \\n  Identical ObservableUnobservable Total \\n   Assets  Inputs  Inputs  Fair  \\n  (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)  Value \\nAssets                 \\nInvestments:                 \\nFixed maturity AFS securities:                 \\nCorporate bonds  $  -

We \\ndo not develop the signiﬁcant inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and the information regarding the \\nsigniﬁcant inputs is not readily available to us.  Independent broker-quoted fair values are non-binding quotes developed by market \\nmakers or broker-dealers obtained from third-party sources recognized as market participants.  The fair value of a broker-quoted asset \\nor liability is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market \\nparticipant as we do not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset or liability.  Signiﬁcant increases or \\ndecreases in any of the quotes received from a third-party broker-dealer may result in a signiﬁcantly higher or lower fair value \\nmeasurement.  \\n \\nChanges in any of the signiﬁcant inputs presented in the table above would have resulted in a signiﬁcant change in the fair value \\nmeasurement of the asset or liability as follows:\\n \\n\\x00Investments – An increase in the liquidity/duration adjustment input would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value \\nmeasurement.\\n\\x00Indexed annuity contracts embedded derivatives – For direct embedded derivatives, an increase in the lapse rate or mortality rate \\ninputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement.  \\n\\x00GLB embedded derivatives – Assuming our GLB direct embedded derivatives are in a liability position:  an increase in our lapse \\nrate, NPR or mortality rate inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement; and an increase in the \\nutilization of guaranteed withdrawal or volatility inputs would have resulted in an increase in the fair value measurement.\\n \\nFor each category discussed above, the unobservable inputs are not inter-related; therefore, a directional change in one input would not \\nhave affected the other inputs.  \\n \\nAs part of our ongoing valuation process, we assess the reasonableness of our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as \\nnecessary.

Controls and Procedures \\n \\n(a)Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures \\n \\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports \\nwe ﬁle or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized \\nand reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information \\nis accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, \\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the \\nsupervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, conducted an evaluation of the \\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that evaluation, \\nour Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in \\ntimely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic \\nreports under the Exchange Act.  \\n \\n(b)Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\n \\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page 103 of “Item 8. Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data” and is incorporated herein by reference. \\n \\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives \\nwill be met.  Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance \\nthat misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have \\nbeen detected.  Projections of any evaluation of controls’ effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  Over time, controls may \\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. \\n \\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\n\\xa0\\nThere was no change in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (as that term is deﬁned in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the \\nExchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to \\nmaterially affect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.\\n\\xa0\\nItem 9B.

Business COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain the virus including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition. With the evolution of milder COVID-19 variants availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus many COVID-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel. In 2022 we experienced a strong recovery in travel demand. However we note that the recovery has been uneven with different regions experiencing different rates of recovery. Despite positive developments the full duration and total impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and therefore it is difficult to predict any future impact on the travel industry and in particular our business. Overview Expedia Group Inc. is an online travel company and our mission is to power global travel for everyone everywhere. We believe travel is a force for good. Travel is an essential human experience that strengthens connections broadens horizons and bridges divides. We leverage our supply portfolio platform and technology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands and provide solutions to our business partners to empower travelers to efficiently research plan book and experience travel. At the end of 2022 we had approximately 3 million lodging properties available including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through Vrbo approximately 900000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands over 500 airlines packages rental cars cruises insurance as well as activities and experiences. Travel suppliers distribute and market products via our apps desktop and mobile offerings as well as through alternative distribution channels our business partnerships and our call centers in order to reach our extensive global audience. In addition our advertising and media businesses help other businesses primarily travel providers reach a large multi-platform audience of travelers around the globe. 130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 5/118Table of Contents Historical Development Over 25 years ago we began operations as one of the first online travel agencies (“OTAs”) and played a significant role in revolutionizing and democratizing travel by empowering customers to manage their own travel plans. We did so by building and then leveraging proprietary technology to connect partners and their respective inventory to those travelers while unlocking the marketplace for travel to other businesses as well. Since then the travel industry has experienced significant transformation including the material shift from offline to online travel booking. This transformation led to many years of exciting growth for OTAs along with increased competition. In order to remain innovative and competitive we made several strategic acquisitions which materially expanded the breadth and depth of our Company. Much of our strategy leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic focused on our brands competing aggressively for share all the around the world each with their own offerings and benefits. However it also created certain complexities and inefficiencies over time. To reduce complexity and improve operations in 2020 we shifted to a platform operating model which enabled us to deliver more scalable services and operate much more efficiently. For example we now manage our marketing investments holistically across the entire brand portfolio allowing us to optimize our spend to achieve better returns and run on a unified marketing technology platform improving our performance by scaling our marketing capabilities. We also shifted to a unified brand strategy within our Retail business where we have a combined team making decisions across all our brands. These changes were made in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and the operation of our business. Moreover to streamline activities and enhance focus on our core businesses we shut down or sold a number of businesses since the beginning of 2020 including Egencia a travel management company focused on corporate travel. On November 1 2021 the sale of Egencia to American Express Global Business Travel (“GBT”) was completed. As part of the transaction Expedia Group received a minority ownership position in the combined business and entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with GBT. Both Egencia pre- closing and the GBT lodging supply agreement impact our B2B segment financials. The result of these cumulative actions enable more focus on improving the overall experience for our travelers. In 2021 we began evolving our consumer retail strategy from being largely transactionally focused where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers through performance marketing channels to building direct longer-lasting relationships with our customers. With that goal in mind we focused towards increasing customer loyalty and app adoption as loyalty members and app users typically experience higher repeat rates gross profits and bookings relative to non-loyalty members and non-app users. Further we aim to provide our customers with a high-quality product experience strong membership benefits and broad multi-product supply offering all of which encourages higher conversion repeat rates and engagement. Market Opportunity and Business Strategy Expedia Group is one of the world’s largest online travel companies yet our gross bookings represent a single-digit percentage of total worldwide travel spending highlighting the size of our market opportunity. Phocuswright estimates global travel spending inclusive of alternative accommodations and tours and activities at approximately $1.6 trillion in 2023. Our focus is to: leverage our brand supply and platform technology strength to provide greater services and value to our travelers suppliers and business partners and build longer-lasting direct relationships with our customers. Leverage Brand and Supply Strength to Power the Travel Ecosystem. We believe the strength of our core brand portfolio and consistent enhancements to product and service offerings combined with our global scale and broad-based supply drive increasing value to customers and customer demand. With our significant global audience of travelers and our deep and broad selection of travel products we are also able to provide value to supply partners seeking to grow their business through sophisticated technology a better understanding of travel retailing and reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach. Our deep product and supply footprint allows us to tailor offerings to target different types of consumers and travel needs employ geographic segmentation in markets around the world and leverage brand differentiation among other benefits. We also market to consumers through a variety of channels including internet search metasearch and social and digital media. Our portfolio of brands operated and organized by reportable segment are as follows: Retail. Our Retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through recognized consumer brands that target a variety of customer segments and geographic regions with tailored offerings. Our portfolio of retail brands include: •Brand Expedia. Brand Expedia is a leading full-service online travel brand in a wide range of countries around the world offering a wide selection of travel products and services. •Hotels.com. Hotels.com focuses on marketing lodging accommodations. 230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 6/118Table of Contents •Vrbo. Vrbo operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry. The Vrbo portfolio includes the vacation rental website Vrbo which operates localized websites around the world as well as other regional brands. •We have multiple other brands including but not limited to Orbitz Travelocity ebookers and Wotif Group. While we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands: Expedia Hotels.com and Vrbo. In 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called “One Key” spanning all our main brands which we expect to launch in 2023. We also market to consumers through a variety of channels including internet search metasearch and social and digital media. B2B. Our B2B segment encompasses our Expedia Partner Solutions business. Expedia Partner Solutions partners with businesses in a wide spectrum of countries across a wide range of travel and non-travel verticals including airlines offline travel agents online retailers corporate travel management and financial institutions who market Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. Expedia Partner Solutions\\' partners can benefit from our technology and supply in the way that best suits their business. This includes connecting to Expedia Group\\'s travel content through Expedia Partner Solutions’ API Rapid; adopting one of Expedia Partner Solutions’ customized white label or co-branded ecommerce template solutions; or a powerful agent booking tool Expedia Travel Affiliate Agent Program (TAAP). Prior to its sale on November 1 2021 our B2B segment also included Egencia which was our full-service travel management company. We also offer an “optimized distribution” product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our B2B segment also includes room nights gross bookings and associated economics from our lodging supply agreement we entered into with GBT in conjunction with the sale of Egencia. trivago. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. trivago is our majority-owned hotel metasearch company based in Dusseldorf Germany. The online platform gives travelers access to price comparisons from hundreds of booking websites for millions of hotels and other accommodations. Officially launched in 2005 trivago is a leading global brand in hotel search and can be accessed worldwide. The company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the symbol \"TRVG.\" Leverage Our Platform to Deliver More Rapid Product Innovation Resulting in Better Traveler Experiences. During 2020 Expedia Group unified its technology product data engineering and data science teams to build services and capabilities that can be leveraged across our business units to provide value-add services to our travel suppliers and serve our end customers. The unified team structure enables us to deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently. All of our transaction-based businesses also now benefit from our shared platform infrastructure including customer servicing and support data centers search capabilities payment processing and fraud operations. As we continue to evolve our shared platform infrastructure our focus is on developing technical capabilities that support various travel products while using simpler standard architecture and common applications and frameworks. We believe this strategy will enable us to: simultaneously build pieces of technology that work in tandem; ship products faster; create more innovative solutions; and achieve greater scale. Ultimately we believe this will result in faster product innovation and therefore better traveler experiences. In addition over time as we execute on our streamlined application development framework we believe we can unlock additional platform service opportunities beyond the scope of our internal brands and business travel partners. In 2021 we began migrating our core Retail brands (Brand Expedia Hotels.com and Vrbo) onto one unified technology front-end infrastructure to increase operating efficiencies. In 2022 we completed the migration of the Hotels.com front-end technology stack on to the Brand Expedia platform which allowed us to apply our learnings from testing and optimization across our traditional lodging portfolio at much greater scale. In late 2022 we began the technology migration of our Vrbo business onto the Brand Expedia front-end and expect that work to be largely complete in 2023. We provide 24-hour-a-day seven-day-a-week traveler sales and support by our virtual agent platform telephone chat or e-mail. For purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and in-house contact centers. Our contact centers are located in several countries throughout the world. We invested significantly in our contact center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our contact center agents and we expect to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward. In addition we have continued to invest in our customer service platform technology which leverages technology and artificial intelligence to provide our customers with online customer service options and self-service capabilities. Today our websites and apps are powered through a combination of legacy company-owned data centers and increasingly via cloud platforms. We are nearing the end of a multi-year project to migrate our products data storage and functionality to public cloud computing services. For our legacy company-owned data centers our systems infrastructure and web and database 330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 7/118Table of Contents servers are housed in various locations mainly in the United States which have 24-hour monitoring and engineering support. These data centers have their own generators and multiple back-up systems. For some critical systems we have both production and disaster-recovery facilities. Our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in Part I Item 1A — Risk Factors. Business Models We make travel products and services available both on a stand-alone and package basis primarily through the following business models: the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model. •Merchant Model. Under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings. For example we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip generally when they book the reservation. The majority of our merchant transactions relate to lodging bookings. •Agency Model. Under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. We record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. Additionally we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our agency gross bookings relate to air bookings. •Advertising Model. Under the advertising model we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings across several of our transaction-based websites as well as on our majority-owned metasearch site trivago. For the year ended December 31 2022 we had total revenue of $11.7 billion with merchant agency and advertising media and other accounting for 66% 26% and 8% of total revenue respectively. Our Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) program offers for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia Group in advance under our merchant model (Expedia Collect) or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay under the agency model (Hotel Collect). In addition through various of our Expedia Group-branded and other multi-product websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Travelers typically select packages based on the total package price or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products. The use of the merchant travel components in packages and multi-product purchases enable us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models. In addition we also offer pre-assembled package offerings further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers. We expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model. Marketing and Promotions Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our retail brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings while optimizing ongoing traveler acquisition costs. Our long-term success and profitability depend on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a cost-effective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our brands. We manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our Retail segment to optimize results for the Company and make decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment. Our marketing channels primarily include brand advertising through online and offline channels loyalty programs mobile apps search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media direct and/or personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct e-mail communication with our travelers. Our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel 430/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 8/118Table of Contents suppliers based on our supplier relationships. Our current traveler loyalty programs include Hotels.com Rewards on Hotels.com global websites and Expedia® Rewards on a wide array of Brand Expedia points of sale as well as Orbitz Rewards on Orbitz.com. In 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called “One Key” spanning all our main brands which we expect to launch in 2023. We also make use of affiliate marketing. Several of our branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clicked through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. In exchange for this traffic we pay the affiliate partner a commission. Travel Suppliers We make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies property owners and managers large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and other travel partners. We seek to build and maintain long-term strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”) partners. An important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners. We strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in need-based seasonal and event-driven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building. We developed proprietary technology to assist both hotel and alternative accommodation suppliers in managing and marketing their supply whether this is direct through our proprietary central reservation tools or through third-party channel managers. Our “direct connect” technology allows suppliers to upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and dynamically manage reservations and traveler needs through our messaging and chat platforms. Marketing tools assist hotels and alternative accommodations in tailoring demand to their requirements and our revenue management product provides pricing insights. We also offer an “Optimized Distribution” product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our suite of white label website offerings power hotel and package booking on suppliers\\' own websites. Vrbo\\'s alternative accommodation listing services offers our supply partners a set of tools to help them manage an availability calendar respond to customer inquiries edit the content of a property listing as well as provide various other services to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume. Distribution Partners. GDSs also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point-to-point flights or ‘segments.’ The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products. Our relationships with GDSs primarily relate to our air business. We use Amadeus and Sabre as our GDS segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers. Competition Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. We believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia Group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses to achieve global scale. We also believe that Expedia Group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace. Our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites. We face these competitors in local regional national and/or international markets. In some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult. We also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs. Retail. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel product supply product features and usability of our websites and mobile apps price or promotional offers customer service as well as offline brand efforts. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic. We face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as Wi-Fi and better pricing. Our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. We face 530/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 9/118530/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 10/118Table of Contents competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation. B2B. We are one of the leading players in the global B2B travel space today servicing a wide range of customers across both travel and non-travel verticals including corporate travel management airlines offline travel agents online retailers and financial institutions. We face competition from travel consolidators and wholesalers of travel products other OTAs with B2B offerings and other technology and content providers. We differentiate ourselves from our B2B competitors primarily with our breadth and depth of global supply dedicated partner and traveler support and market leading travel technology through our Rapid API white label or co-branded template offerings and Expedia Travel Affiliate Agent Program (TAAP) a powerful agent booking tool. We also offer an “optimized distribution” product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our extensive work building out our global supply has allowed us to negotiate competitive pricing with suppliers and provide added value to travelers. We intend to continue to grow the business via a combination of increasing our wallet share with existing customers winning contracts with new customers as well as the introduction of additional products and services. Intellectual Property Rights Our intellectual property and appurtenant rights including our patents trademarks copyright rights domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are important components of our business. For example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website URLs software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that support and make up our services. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties. We protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights. In addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties. We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate and necessary respectively. We protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses. Trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate. Contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract. We have established a formal patent program with a newly-formed Patent Review Committee for evaluating our innovations and determining the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions and obtaining licenses in patents as circumstances may warrant and we anticipate continuing to devote greater resources to seeking patent protection for Expedia Group’s innovations. In connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar Host Privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other content uploaded by users. However differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity. From time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business. 630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 11/118Table of Contents Regulation We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the alternative accommodation industry internet businesses and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds In addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility. We are also increasingly subject to new and evolving short-term rental laws and regulations that impose additional property registration disclosure and data provision requirements. In international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific value-added tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages. For example the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure. Additionally we must comply with an expanding array of international laws and regulations aimed at online businesses including the European Union’s Digital Services Act and DAC7 which impose new information gathering and reporting requirements as well as obligations to respond to inquiries about website content. We are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data payments labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and anti-trust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry. For example the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) came into force in January 2023 and applies enhanced data protection requirements in the State of California similar to those that have existed since 2018 under the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Five other U.S. states have passed similar laws and data protection laws have been passed or are being discussed in a number of other jurisdictions. These data protection/privacy laws add compliance complexity risks and costs. Compliance with these laws rules and regulation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. However certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to our business in the future.

COVID-19 Response Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic our employees have remained focused on providing positive experiences for travelers. After reopening our global offices with enhanced health and safety measures we adopted a hybrid work model for most of our offices in April 2022 designed to make the most of the productivity and collaborative energy that comes from working together in our offices while preserving the convenience and flexibility of working from home. In parallel we augmented benefits programs to support employees with the transition including expanding the scope of our travel and wellness allowance to include home office expenses and a broader range of mental and emotional health services; offering new telehealth wellness education and family support services; and making existing resources and services easier to access via online channels.

Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors          You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks occur our business and/or financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and/or financial performance. COVID-19 Pandemic and Travel Industry Risks The COVID-19 pandemic had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on the travel industry and our business financial performance and liquidity position. Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and have had an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry. Containment measures have included and in some cases continue to include travel restrictions bans and advisories social distancing measures curfews quarantine restrictions after travel in certain locations border closures “shelter-in-place” orders required closures of non-essential businesses vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees’ vaccination status and other restrictions. The pandemic had and may continue to have a number of material adverse impacts on our business financial performance and liquidity position. For example in 2020 we experienced significantly reduced levels of new bookings significantly heightened levels of cancellations and instigated traveler-centric modifications to our cancellation policies. As a result we experienced a significant increase in refunds which led to materially negative cash flow that negatively impacted our cash balance and overall liquidity position. The pandemic also had a significant adverse effect on many of the partners on which our business relies including accommodation providers and airlines as well as on the traveling public generally and our employees. In addition the pandemic impeded global economic activity for an extended period and could continue to do so leading to a continuation of the already significant decrease in per capita income and disposable income increased and sustained unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence all of which would significantly reduce discretionary spending on travel. 930/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 14/118930/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 15/118Table of Contents In turn that could have a negative impact on demand for our services and could lead our partners or us to reduce prices or offer incentives to attract travelers. We also cannot predict the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our partners and their business and operations or the ways that the pandemic may fundamentally alter the travel industry or consumer habits. In particular we may need to adapt to a travel industry with fewer and different suppliers as well as structural changes to certain types of travel. Our mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had or may continue to have negative impact. For example in response to the spread of COVID-19 in early 2020 we incurred significant additional indebtedness and took other actions including the ultimate adoption of a hybrid work policy that could lead to disruptions in our business reduced employee morale and productivity increased attrition and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic including as a result of possible subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 or of new variants thereof and measures taken in response thereto will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise. It is therefore difficult to estimate with accuracy the impact to our future revenues results of operations cash flows liquidity or financial condition but such impacts have been and may continue to be significant and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity position for the foreseeable future. We operate in an intensely competitive global environment and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors. The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive. We compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travel-related services including online travel agencies; alternative accommodation providers; wholesalers and tour operators; travel product suppliers (including hotels airlines and car rental companies); search engines and large online portal websites; travel metasearch services; corporate travel management service providers; mobile platform travel applications; social media websites; eCommerce and group buying websites; and other participants in the travel industry. Online travel agencies and alternative accommodations providers. In particular we face intense competition from other OTAs and alternative accommodations in many regions such as Booking Holdings (through its Booking.com Priceline.com and Agoda.com websites) Airbnb and Trip.com any of which may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth. Our OTA competitors are increasingly expanding the range of travel services they offer and the global OTA segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships. Airbnb Booking Holdings and other providers of alternative accommodations provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available through Expedia Group brands including Vrbo. The continued growth of alternative accommodation providers could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations. Furthermore Airbnb has and similar providers could increasingly look to add other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional OTAs. Travel suppliers. Travel suppliers such as hotels airlines and rental car companies may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them. Many of these competitors have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of third-party distributors through favorable rates and bonus or loyalty points for direct bookings surcharges for booking outside of the supplier’s own website or preferred booking technologies suppliers combining to establish a single search platform and other tactics to drive traffic directly to supplier websites. Search engines and large online portal websites. We also face intense competition from Google and other search engines. There could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance to the extent that Google continues to use its market position to disintermediate online travel agencies through its own offerings or capabilities refer customers directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites offer the ability to transact on its own website or promote its own competing products by placing its own offerings at the top of organic search results. In recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to OTAs. For example Google has continued to add features and functionality to its Google Travel Google Flights” and Hotel Ads travel metasearch products. In addition Google may be able to leverage the data they collect on users to the detriment of us and other OTAs. Search engines may also continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. 1030/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 16/118Table of Contents In addition our brands or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travel-related companies. Competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites. Travel metasearch websites. Travel metasearch websites including Kayak.com (a subsidiary of Booking Holdings) trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of Expedia Group) TripAdvisor Skyscanner and Qunar (both are subsidiaries of Trip.com) aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites. In addition some metasearch websites have looked to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands. To the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our traffic-generating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue. To the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if OTA advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted. Corporate travel management service providers. By virtue of our minority ownership stake in and long-term supply agreement with GBT we compete indirectly with online and traditional corporate travel providers as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services. Our brands also compete to attract unmanaged business travelers. Mobile and other platform travel applications. The demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly. If we are unable to offer innovative user-friendly feature-rich mobile applications and mobile-responsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobile-responsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. Applications and social media websites. Applications and social media websites including Facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into alternative research and booking resources for travelers resulting in additional competition. eCommerce and group buying websites. Traditional consumer eCommerce platforms including Amazon and Alibaba and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market. For example traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites. To the extent our travelers use these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses. Other participants in the travel industry. Other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients. For example ride-sharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate. To the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses. In general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or offer differentiated products and services to our travelers. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity. Some of our competitors may also have other significant advantages such as greater financial resources or name recognition more favorable corporate structures or a broader global presence among others. Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or health-related events our business and financial performance are affected by the overall health of the worldwide travel industry. Factors that could negatively affect the travel industry in general and our business in particular potentially materially include: macroeconomic concerns including recessions political instability and geopolitical conflicts (such as the war in Ukraine) trade disputes significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues bans on travel to and from certain countries significant changes in oil 1130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 17/118Table of Contents prices continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation reduced access to discount fares travel strikes or labor unrest labor shortages whether due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise bankruptcies or liquidations increased incidents of actual or threatened terrorism natural disasters travel-related accidents or grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns and changes to visa and immigration requirements or border control policies. Our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and Average Daily Rates (“ADRs”) changes in airline capacity and airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically. Because these events or concerns and the full impact of their effects are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers and decrease demand. Decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity war or travel-related health events could result in significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity particularly if we as we often have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions and travel-related health events provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services. Our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and other B2B partners. An important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers (including owners and managers of alternative accommodation properties) GDS partners and other B2B partners. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular lodging suppliers airlines and GDS partners for bookings made through our channels. Each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts. No assurances can be given that travel suppliers will elect to participate in our platform or that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services (for example ADRs or ticket prices); attempt to implement costly direct connections; charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content; increase credit card fees or fees for other services; fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses. Likewise no assurance can be given that our other B2B partners will elect to participate in our platform or that our compensation will not be reduced. Any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance. Financial Risks We may experience constraints in our liquidity and may whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors out of our control be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position. If our liquidity is materially diminished we may not be able to timely pay debts or leases or comply with material provisions of our contractual obligations. Although our cash flows from operations and available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet obligations and commitments to date we cannot predict how the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts could affect our liquidity in the future. Our indebtedness the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness and market conditions may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to meet potential future liquidity needs. In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or health-related events we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel and advertising businesses and payment terms with suppliers. If as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic our merchant hotel business declines it would likely result in further pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity. Our ability to raise financing depends in significant measure on characteristics of the capital and credit markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. Due to uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we cannot guarantee that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or other actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. In addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s Moody’s Investor Service Fitch or similar ratings agencies deterioration of our financial condition increase in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening 1230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 18/118Table of Contents in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital (including with respect to ratings downgrades the interest rate applicable to certain of our outstanding senior notes). Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial condition. As of December 31 2022 we have outstanding long-term indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of $6.3 billion and we have an essentially untapped revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion. Risks relating to our indebtedness include: • Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; • Making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses; • Limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; • Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less levered; • Requiring us to use cash and/or issue shares of our Class A common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes; • Diluting our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and • Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at undesirable rates or terms we find acceptable. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things: • Cause or permit certain subsidiaries to borrow money and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees; • Grant certain liens on certain of our assets; • Enter into certain asset sale transactions; and • Enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition our revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant which effectively limits our ability to incur and/or maintain indebtedness. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness (including the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes) may result in an event of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds. In addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. The terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify. Operational Risks Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other traffic-generating arrangements. We rely heavily on internet search engines such as Google through the purchase of travel-related keywords and through organic search to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the placement or cost of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected. In addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on search engines including Google and travel metasearch websites including Kayak TripAdvisor and trivago. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively. Moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or display of results which 1330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 19/118Table of Contents could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results. In particular Google has in the past and may continue to in the future change its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid and unpaid of our websites the websites of our affiliates and those of our third-party distribution partners which adversely impacts our business and financial performance. Google has also increasingly added its own travel search functionality and content at the expense of traditional paid listings and organic search results which may continue to reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates. If Google or other search or metasearch companies continue to pursue these or similar strategies which is out of our control or we do not successfully manage our paid and unpaid search strategies we could face a significant decrease in traffic to our websites and/or increased costs related to replacing unpaid traffic with paid traffic. We rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing. We invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in existing and emerging markets. We expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase and given current economic uncertainty and unpredictability decisions we make on investing in brands could be less effective and costlier than expected. In recent years certain online travel companies and metasearch websites expanded their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future. Our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be cost-effective or as efficient as they have been historically resulting in less direct traffic and increased customer acquisition costs. Moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the Expedia Group portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio. In addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We are subject to payments-related risks. Payments Regulations. The processing and acceptance of a variety of payment methods is subject to various laws rules regulations legal interpretations and regulatory guidance including those governing cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; foreign exchange; payment services; and consumer protection. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services. Moreover for existing and future payment options we offer to both our customers and suppliers we are and may increasingly be subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes such as the EEA’s Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) which came into effect on January 1 2021. PSD2 imposed new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication (“SCA”) that have and may increasingly make it more difficult and costly to carry out a payment transaction successfully. The lack of industry wide adoption of SCA may continue to add to the complexity of payment transactions for us and our suppliers. Third-Party Payment Service Providers. We rely on agreements with third-party service providers to process our voluminous customer credit and debit card transactions and for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers. Upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition these agreements may allow the payment processors to withhold a significant amount of our cash (referred to as a “holdback”) require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been settled by a provider but where the traveler has have not traveled or suspend their processing services. An imposition of a holdback or suspension of payment processing services by one or more of our payment processors could materially reduce our liquidity. Further the software and services provided by payment processors may fail to meet our expectations contain errors or vulnerabilities be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to process payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Payment Card Networks. The payment card networks such as Visa MasterCard and American Express may increase the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks and may impose special fees or assessments on such transactions. Certain of our payment processors also have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us which could significantly increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our financial performance. 1430/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 20/118Table of Contents In addition the payment card networks have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept payment cards and include payment card association operating rules the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards or the PCI DSS. Moreover the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with or costly to implement. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We are subject to payments-related fraud risks. Our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points. We are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings (referred to as a “charge back”). In addition the payment card networks have rules around acceptable charge back ratios. Accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms (such as historically occurred with the introduction of smartphones tablet computers and in-home assistants) and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. In addition we have not broadly adopted certain protective capabilities across our platform such as mobile application-based multi-factor authentication or third-party identify verification which approach could result in significantly increased fraudulent activity on our platform in the future. If we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs we may also be subject to significant fines and higher transaction fees or payment card networks may revoke our access to their networks meaning we would be unable to continue to accept card payments either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial positions. In addition we may be subject to fraudulent supplier schemes. For example when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications. A fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services. Any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance. We work closely with various business partners and rely on third-parties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities. We have numerous significant commercial arrangements with business partners and we rely on third-party service providers for a broad ranges of key services including both external customer-facing services such as customer support and booking fulfillment and internal services related to our operations technology development and infrastructure. If these partners or service providers fail to meet our requirements or legal or regulatory requirements it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions. Likewise if one of our third-party service providers were to cease operations face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and disruption to our own business operations until an equivalent alternative could be sourced or developed any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. Our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intend to continue to expand our international presence. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences (as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes) of each country into which we expand could slow our growth or prevent our ability to compete effectively in certain markets. For example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locally-preferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud. Certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins if the proportion of our overall revenue from these markets grow over time. Additionally some countries have enacted or are considering enacting various regulations such as data localization laws that make competition by foreign companies costly or operationally difficult in those markets. 1530/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 21/118Table of Contents In addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including: • Exposure to local economic or political instability and threatened or actual acts of terrorism; • Compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption antitrust or competition economic sanctions data content and privacy consumer protection employment and labor laws health and safety information reporting and advertising and promotions; • Weaker enforcement of our contractual and intellectual property rights; • Lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment and fraud risk; • Longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; • Preferences by local populations for local providers; • Restrictions on or adverse tax and other consequences related to the repatriation of cash the withdrawal of non-U.S. investments cash balances and earnings as well as restrictions on our ability to invest in our operations in certain countries; • Changes to trade policy or agreements that limit our ability to offer or adversely affect demand for our products and services; • Our ability to support technologies or marketing channels that may be prevalent in a particular international market and used by local competitors but are not scalable for an international company offering services in many markets around the world; and • Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent. Acquisitions investments divestitures or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties. We have acquired invested in divested or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future success may depend in part on such transactions any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Certain financial and operational risks related to such transactions that may have a material impact on our business are: • Diversion of management’s attention or other resources from our existing businesses; • Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding and after consummating acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; • Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences including changes in fair value of contingent consideration; • Expected and unexpected costs incurred in pursuing acquisitions if unsuccessful could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition; • Impairment of relationships with employees suppliers customers vendors and affiliates of our business and the acquired business; • The assumption of known and unknown debt and other liabilities and obligations of the acquired company; • Difficulties and expenses in integrating or separating as the case may be the operations products technology privacy protection systems information systems or personnel of an acquired or divested company including in the case of a divestiture our reliance on performance by the acquiring company; • Failure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated integration synergies traffic transactions revenues earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees; • Failure to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions and investments or returns in excess of alternative uses of capital; • Entrance into markets or segments in which we have no direct prior experience resulting in increased complexity in our business; 1630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 22/118Table of Contents • Challenges relating to the structure of an investment such as governance accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments; • Costs associated with remediating fraud information security or other similar incidents at an acquired company; • Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from our acquisitions • Costs associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company; • Increased or unexpected costs or delays to obtain governmental or regulatory approvals for acquisitions; • Divestitures of functions assets or operations may impede our ability to successfully operate our business result in liability to purchasers or consume significant resources; • Divested assets may be worth more than the consideration we receive in respect thereof; • Increased competition amongst potential acquirers for acquisition targets could result in a material increase in the purchase price for such targets or otherwise limit our ability to consummate acquisitions; • Increased regulatory scrutiny of our core or acquired business; and • Adverse market reaction to divestitures acquisitions or investments or failure to consummate such transactions. Moreover we often rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. We rely on the performance of our employees and if we are unable to retain motivate or hire qualified personnel our business would be harmed. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition for well- qualified employees is intense in almost all categories including for software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals and in all geographies. The competition for talent is also exacerbated by an increased willingness of certain companies to offer flexible and remote working policies which expands the pool of candidates from which our competitors may attract talent. This could continue in the future due to other companies recruiting and hiring our employees an actual or perceived slower pace of recovery of the travel industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic than other industries and other factors beyond our control. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining well-qualified employees our business our ability to execute and innovate our competitive position and results of operations would be adversely affected. The current labor market is highly competitive and our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent are increasing and may increase further which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition the contributions of Barry Diller our Chairman and Senior Executive Peter Kern our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as well as other members of our travel leadership team are critical to the overall management of the company. Expedia Group cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller Mr. Kern or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives or our efforts to increase our operational efficiencies which may adversely affect our business. In recent years we have undertaken a number of significant multi-year strategic initiatives to provide greater services and value to our travelers suppliers and business partners. The most significant of these initiatives are described below in Part I. Item 1. Business under the caption “Market Opportunity and Business Strategy.” We may not realize the benefits we expect to achieve from these and our other strategic initiatives or our efforts may negatively impact our business and operations due to a variety of factors including but not limited to unexpected delays operational or technological challenges or higher than expected costs or expenses. As a result our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. 1730/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 23/118Table of Contents We are exposed to various counterparty risks. We are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform. This creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages letters of credit and for certain of our transactions the receipt and holding of traveler payments and subsequent remittance of a portion of those payments to travel suppliers. As it relates to deposits as of December 31 2022 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately $3.8 billion and held term deposits of approximately $18 million. Additionally majority-owned subsidiaries held cash of approximately $96 million and held term deposits of approximately $218 million. As it relates to foreign exchange as of December 31 2022 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately $2.8 billion the fair value of which was a net asset of approximately $15 million. We employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these term deposits or forward contracts our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets held may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding and the receipt and remittance of payments via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In addition we face significant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to non-financial contract counterparties including our B2B and Vrbo partners which may be exacerbated by economic downturns. The realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. We have foreign exchange risk. We face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates (particularly those related to the Euro British pound Canadian dollar Australian dollar Brazilian real and Swiss Franc currencies) that revalue our cash flows monetary assets and liabilities and translate our foreign subsidiary financial results to U.S. dollars. In particular we face exposure related to fluctuations in accommodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay as well as the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border travel such as from Europe to the United States and the United States to Europe. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies. In addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures. In the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our alternative accommodations business is subject to legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our alternative accommodations business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the alternative accommodation industry and the ability of companies like us to list those alternative accommodations online. For example certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or that regulate platforms’ ability to list alternative accommodations including prohibiting the listing of unlicensed properties. Other domestic and foreign jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations. Many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term rentals. In addition many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the alternative accommodation industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business. These new and evolving regulatory schemes may decrease listings available on our sites and add significant compliance risks to our business including the risk of fines for noncompliance as well as substantial internal costs and the allocation of resources to develop new internal compliance systems and processes. These obligations include gathering information about property owners verification of registration status of properties and the ongoing provision of information to governments about short-term rental owners and operators and requirements to withhold and report taxable income to governments. For example short-term rental regulations currently under consideration in the European Union could require us to provide data to governments about short-term rentals listed on our sites in multiple EU countries. We may also remove properties from our websites if alternative accommodation owners or operators do not provide information we require to comply with applicable regulations. 1830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 24/118Table of Contents We are not in a position to eliminate risks such as personal injury robbery or other harm at alternative accommodation properties and we do not inspect or verify safety such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors which could result in claims of liability based on events occurring at properties listed on our platforms. We have also experienced instances where properties listed on our sites are copied and travelers booking these properties outside of our websites are the subject of fraudulent requests for payment. In other cases travelers have been asked to pay for their booking of properties listed on our website directly to the alternative accommodation operator and outside of our website resulting in loss of revenue for us and increased risk of fraud for the traveler. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our alternative accommodations business including impacting our reputation and brand as well as the results of operations of our alternative accommodations business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Expedia Group’s operations and financial results. A failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth. Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and alternative accommodation licensing and listing requirements the provision of travel packages the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection licensing and regulations relating to the offer of travel insurance and related products anti-corruption anti-trust and competition (including our contractual provisions regarding pricing and travel suppliers) economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security the provision of payment services and privacy. For example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and user-generated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services and our contractual relationships with travel suppliers who list on our sites. Additionally some jurisdictions have implemented or are considering implementing regulations that restrict or could restrict access to city centers and popular destinations as well as impact our ability to offer accommodations such as by limiting the construction of new hotels or renting of alternative accommodations. Also compliance with the European Economic Community (“EEC”) Council Directive on Package Travel Package Holidays and Package Tours could be costly and complex and could adversely impact our ability to offer certain packages in the EEC. Likewise the SEC Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations anti-money laundering and anti- corruption laws across industries. As regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. For example on May 17 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with OFAC regarding 2221 potentially non-compliant Cuba-related travel transactions that occurred between 2011-2014 which we voluntarily disclosed to OFAC in 2014. In connection with the settlement agreement we made significant enhancements to our economic sanctions\\' compliance program and associated controls. OFAC agreed to release us without any finding of fault from all civil liability in connection with the potential violations. In the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands. We also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with economic sanctions consumer protection competition tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including Expedia Group and the presentation of information to consumers as described in Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Competition and Consumer Matters. The failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations. Application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities. The application of domestic and international income and non-income tax laws rules and regulations to our products and services is subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. The taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation and enforcement of such laws rules and regulations resulting in increased audit activity and audit assessments. As such potential tax liabilities may exceed our current tax reserves. Taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits and/or levied assessments asserting we are required to collect and/or remit state and local sales or use taxes value added taxes or other transactional taxes related to our travel facilitation services including the legal proceedings described in Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 1930/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 25/118Table of Contents Judgment and estimation are required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business there are calculations and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. Taxing authorities may disagree with our tax calculations including transfer pricing. We believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits may be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties or may require payment of tax assessments prior to contesting the validity of the assessment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations. We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our future tax liabilities may be adversely affected by legislative and other changes to taxing regimes as well as changes in our business operating structure and the mix of revenue and earnings in countries with differing tax rates. Due to the pace of legislative changes and the scale of our business activities any substantial changes in tax policies or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the taxes we are required to pay our financial position and results of operations. Taxing jurisdictions around the world have focused legislative efforts on tax reform transparency base erosion and have enacted or are considering enacting digital services taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to advance proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules with the goal of having the participant countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework however there can be no guarantee this will occur. Many of the current tax laws rules and regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were enacted before the growth of the digital economy. Certain jurisdictions have enacted legislation directed at taxing the digital economy and multi-national businesses. If existing tax laws rules or regulations change by amendment or new legislation the result could increase our tax liabilities and reporting obligations including requirements to provide information about travel suppliers customers and transactions on our technology platform. The outcome of these changes may have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance including a decrease in demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer; an increase in the volume and cost of our tax reporting and compliance obligations; or limit the scope of our business activities if we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions. We are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are involved in various legal proceedings and disputes involving taxes personal injury contract alleged infringement of third- party intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings. These matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. The defense of these actions has been and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and the outcomes of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. We cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from all forms of copying or use by others including potential competitors. Our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands trademarks domain names and technology much of which is proprietary. We establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark domain name copyright trade secret and patent laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures. In connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property. Even with these precautions however third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or confusingly similar trademarks or domain names without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently. Effective trademark domain name copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites. We 2030/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 26/118Table of Contents also license content from suppliers for our creative campaigns. As we continue to build our creative production work and introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content and brands. We cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all. We also cannot be sure that content obtained from suppliers won’t be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by a third party. Technology Information Protection and Privacy Risks We rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and if we fail to adequately maintain or improve our information technology systems or to adapt them to technological developments and industry trends our business and operations could be adversely affected. We depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems in many areas of our business including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity marketing communications procurement payments tax collection and remittance fraud detection and administration which we must continuously improve and upgrade. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings. Cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants and developing technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments. Transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers. We have been engaged in a multi-year effort to migrate products data storage and processing key portions of our consumer and affiliate sites as well as back-office application functionality to new technology platforms and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits. Implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our ability to develop new site features. We may be unable to successfully migrate and improve our technology as planned or we may not achieve the expected benefits from any such initiatives and as a result our business including customer relationships reputation and operations could be materially adversely affected. System interruption security breaches and unplanned outages in our information systems may harm our businesses. The risk of a cybersecurity-related attack by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent. Due to the size and scale of our technology infrastructure and overall operations vulnerabilities present within our systems may result in unauthorized access to confidential data including our own proprietary data that of our partners or the personal data of our customers including payment data. In addition given the nature of our operations consumer personal and payment data may also be accessed inappropriately within partner systems should those partners also experience a breach. In addition we continue to encounter attempted external attacks in a variety of forms including ransomware account takeovers phishing and denial of service attacks. As these continue there is a risk that successful attacks may cause a significant cybersecurity incident which impacts our critical operations. Successful attacks have the potential to damage our reputation increase costs and result in regulatory scrutiny or fines. As we continue to migrate legacy systems to newer information technology systems we increase the risk of system interruptions. We have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. Significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon - including multiple co-location providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers - and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs and/or cause losses. We also face risks related to our ability to maintain data and hardware security with respect to remote working. No assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances. Although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and 2130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 27/118Table of Contents assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. In addition as a result of our migration of key portions of our platform functionality to AWS we now depend on the availability of AWS’s services and any incident affecting AWS’s infrastructure and availability which have occurred a number of times in the recent past could adversely affect the availability of our platform and our ability to serve our customers which could in turn damage our reputation with current and potential customers expose us to liability result in substantial costs for remediation cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business financial condition or results of operations. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative hosting sources or taking other actions in preparation for or in reaction to events that compromise the AWS services we use. We process store and use customer supplier and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction. There are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. We strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. It is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of our businesses. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with privacy-related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. The risk of a data incident due to cybersecurity-related privacy event remains persistent. In addition such an event could result in violations of applicable U.S. and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation. We are subject to privacy regulations and compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. Several U.S. states including California have passed comprehensive privacy legislation or are considering privacy legislation. In addition the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR that went into effect in the European Union in May 2018 requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations regarding the handling of personal data. Enforcement of GDPR regulations and fines for non-compliance continue to increase and a significant number of additional jurisdictions are expected to enact similar privacy regulations in the future. As additional jurisdictions enact privacy regulations and laws we will experience increased compliance costs and uncertainty as to how such laws will be interpreted. Although we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to comply with the GDPR and other privacy laws and regulations the number and variety of regulations combined with our multi-product multi-brand global businesses could nevertheless result in compliance failures. Failure to meet any of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability adverse publicity and/or damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition. Environmental Social and Governance Risks Mr. Diller may be deemed to beneficially own shares representing approximately 27% of the outstanding voting power of Expedia Group. As of December 31 2022 Mr. Diller may be deemed to have beneficially owned 100% of Expedia Group’s outstanding Class B common stock representing approximately 27% of the total voting power of all shares of Expedia Group common stock and Class B common stock outstanding. In the future Mr. Diller’s ownership percentage in Expedia Group could increase if he acquires additional shares of Expedia Group common stock in open market purchases or otherwise or if Expedia Group repurchases shares of its common stock. Mr. Diller is also currently the Chairman of Expedia Group’s Board of Directors and Senior Executive of Expedia Group. Expedia Group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Chairman of the Board may only be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the entire Board of Directors which provision may not be 2230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 28/118Table of Contents amended altered changed or repealed or any provision inconsistent therewith adopted without the approval of at least (1) 80% of the entire Board of Directors and (2) 80% of the voting power of Expedia Group’s outstanding voting securities voting together as a single class. As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and voting power Mr. Diller is in a position to influence and potentially control significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets. Additionally in the future another holder of the Class B Shares might have such a position of influence by virtue of ownership interests in the Class B Shares. This concentrated ownership position could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to Expedia Group stockholders. Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between Expedia Group management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of IAC on the other. Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive while retaining his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp or IAC. Each of Ms. Clinton and Mr. von Furstenberg also serves as a member of the Board of Directors of both Expedia Group and IAC. These overlapping relationships could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for the directors or officers when facing decisions that may affect both IAC and Expedia Group. Mr. Diller in particular may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between the companies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of Expedia Group who is also an officer or director of IAC will be liable to Expedia Group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia Group or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to Expedia Group because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia Group. Increased focus on our environmental social and governance (\"ESG\") responsibilities have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks and may adversely impact our reputation employee retention and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us. Institutional individual and other investors proxy advisory services regulatory authorities consumers employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices of companies including climate change diversity equity and inclusion human capital management data privacy and security supply chains (including human rights issues) among other topics. These evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to respond to and manage these issues provide updates on them and establish and meet appropriate goals commitments and targets present numerous operational regulatory reputational financial legal and other risks and impacts any of which may be outside of our control or could have a material adverse impact on our business including on our reputation and stock price. Our efforts in this area may result in a significant increase in costs and may nevertheless not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and evolving standards or regulatory requirements which may negatively impact our financial results our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees our attractiveness as a service provider investment or business partner or expose us to government enforcement actions private litigation and actions by stockholders or stakeholders. Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business. Our businesses may also be negatively impacted by direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Direct impacts may include disruptions to travel and to our operations due to more frequent or severe storms hurricanes flooding rising sea levels shortages of water droughts and wildfires. Indirect impacts may include a significant shift in consumer preferences which we may not successfully adapt to or the general harm to our business as a result of a general perception of travel as an environmental harm. These and other climate change related impacts could have a significant adverse impact on our business in both the short medium and long term. Further there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations could be significant. Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock Our stock price is highly volatile. 2330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 29/118Table of Contents The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other risks the risks described in this Item 1A as well as: • Quarterly variations in our operating and financial results as well as that of our peer companies; • Operating and financial results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors including failure to deliver returns on investments or key initiatives; • Changes in our capital or governance structure; • Repurchases of our common stock; • Changes in the stock price or market valuations of trivago our majority-owned publicly traded subsidiary whose stock price is also highly volatile; • Changes in device and platform technologies and search industry dynamics such as key word pricing and traffic or other changes that negatively affect our ability to generate traffic to our websites; • Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions divestitures strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments as well as technological innovations new services or promotional and discounting activities; • Dilution resulting from any conversion of our convertible debt into common stock; • Loss of a major travel supplier such as an airline hotel or car rental chain; • Lack of success in our efforts to increase our market share; and • Price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general. Volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors and/or invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments. Part I. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Part I. Item 2. Properties We own our corporate headquarters located in Seattle Washington which is approximately 650000 square feet of office space. In addition we lease approximately 2.3 million square feet of office space worldwide in various cities and locations pursuant to leases with expiration dates through May 2038 of which approximately 865000 square feet is leased for domestic operations and 1.4 million for international operations. Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business Expedia Group and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property personal injury contract alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and other statutory and common law claims. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incident to the registrant’s business and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management none of the pending litigation matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending including those described below involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or results of operations based upon the standard set forth in the SEC’s rules. Litigation Relating to Occupancy and Other Taxes A number of jurisdictions in the United States have filed lawsuits against online travel companies including Expedia Group companies such as Hotels.com Expedia Hotwire Orbitz and HomeAway claiming that such travel companies have failed to collect and/or pay taxes (e.g. occupancy taxes business privilege taxes excise taxes sales taxes etc.) as well as related claims such as unjust enrichment restitution conversion and violation of consumer protection statutes and seeking monetary (including tax interest and penalties) injunctive and/or declaratory relief. In addition we may file complaints 2430/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 30/118Table of Contents contesting tax assessments made by states counties and municipalities seeking to obligate online travel companies including certain Expedia Group companies to collect and remit certain taxes either retroactively or prospectively or both. Moreover certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments. This requirement is commonly referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously. Actions Filed by Individual States Cities and Counties Pine Bluff Arkansas Litigation. In September 2009 Pine Bluff Advertising and Promotion Commission and Jefferson County filed a putative class action against a number of online travel companies including Expedia Hotels.com Hotwire and Orbitz alleging that defendants failed to collect and/or pay taxes under hotel tax occupancy ordinances. In February 2018 the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the issue of tax liability. The matter is currently pending in the trial court on damages issues. State of Mississippi Litigation. In December 2011 the State of Mississippi brought suit against a number of online travel companies including Expedia Hotels.com Hotwire and Orbitz for declaratory judgment injunctive relief violations of the state sales tax statute and local ordinances violation of Consumer Protection Act (subsequently dismissed) conversion unjust enrichment constructive trust money had and received and joint venture liability. In October 2018 the trial court granted the State of Mississippi’s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability after which the case proceeded to a damages phase in the trial court. In a July 12 2021 final judgment the trial court found the defendant online travel companies liable for state and local sales taxes and interest and also held the defendants liable for penalties. An appeal of the final judgment to the Mississippi Supreme Court remains pending. Arizona Cities Litigation. Tax assessments were issued in 2013 by 12 Arizona cities against a group of online travel companies including Expedia Hotels.com Hotwire and Orbitz. The online travel companies protested and petitioned for redetermination of the assessments. On May 28 2014 the Municipal Tax Hearing Officer granted the online travel companies\\' protests and ordered the cities to abate the assessments. The cities appealed to the Arizona Tax Court which granted the cities\\' motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part in April 2016. The matter is currently pending in the Arizona Tax Court on damages issues. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on damages issues in 2020.

Competition and Consumer Matters Over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities (“NCAs”) particularly in Europe. Matters Relating to Contractual Provisions with Accommodations Providers Expedia Group companies are or have been involved in a number of investigations by NCAs predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between Expedia Group entities and accommodation providers (sometimes also referred to as “most favored nation” or “MFN” provisions) are anti-competitive. In 2015 Expedia Group companies voluntarily waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with European hotel partners resulting in most NCAs in Europe closing their investigations. However certain related matters remain ongoing including cases brought by the German Federal Cartel Office. Legislative bodies in France Austria Italy Belgium and Portugal have also adopted domestic anti-parity clause legislation which we believe in each case violates both EU and national legal principles. In December 2022 Switzerland also passed legislation taking action on price parity in Switzerland. 2630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 32/118Table of Contents A number of NCAs outside of Europe have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including Expedia Group companies. In certain of these jurisdictions including Australia Brazil Hong Kong South Korea Japan and New Zealand the concerns were resolved with Expedia Group companies’ waiver of certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with hotel partners in the respective jurisdictions. Matters Relating to Online Marketplaces Regulatory authorities in Europe (including the UK Competition and Markets Authority or “CMA”) Australia and elsewhere have also undertaken market studies inquiries or investigations relating to the presentation of information on certain of our UK and European Union consumer-facing websites. We have agreed to offer certain voluntary undertakings in order to address the regulatory authorities\\' concerns. We are cooperating with regulators in the investigations described above where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Expedia Group\\'s mission is to power global travel for everyone everywhere. We believe travel is a force for good. Travel is an essential human experience that strengthens connections broadens horizons and bridges divides. We help reduce the barriers to travel making it easier more enjoyable more attainable and more accessible. We bring the world within reach for customers and partners around the globe. We leverage our supply portfolio platform and technology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands and provide solutions to our business partners to empower travelers to efficiently research plan book and experience travel. We make available on a stand-alone and package basis travel services provided by numerous lodging properties airlines car rental companies activities and experiences providers cruise lines alternative accommodations property owners and managers and other travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on our websites. For additional information about our portfolio of brands see the disclosure set forth in Part I Item 1 Business under the caption “Market Opportunity and Business Strategy.” This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses the years ended December 31 2022 and 2021 items and year over year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of the year ended December 31 2020 items and the year over year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II Item 7 of the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2021. All percentages within this section are calculated on actual unrounded numbers. Trends The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain the virus including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition. With the evolution of milder COVID-19 variants availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus many COVID-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel. However we note that the recovery has been uneven with different regions experiencing different rates of recovery. Despite positive developments the full duration and total impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and therefore it is difficult to predict any future impact on the travel industry and in particular our business. More recently inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy such as rising interest rates appreciation of the dollar energy price volatility and inflationary pressures have contributed to an increasingly complex macroeconomic environment. Our future operational results may be subject to volatility particularly in the short-term due to the impact of the aforementioned trends. Broad sustained negative economic impacts could put strain on our suppliers business and service partners which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions. Additionally further health-related events political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sustained levels of increased inflation sovereign debt issues and natural disasters are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. Despite these factors we have witnessed a healthy recovery of travel demand which remains strong and is attributable to factors including pent-up demand from the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers prioritizing spend on travel and experiences over other discretionary spending. We have also executed cost savings initiatives aimed at simplifying the organization and increasing efficiency achieving by 2021 forward annualized run-rate fixed cost savings of $700 to $750 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 exit rate as well as greater than $200 million in variable costs savings at 2019 volume levels. We also believe we have improved our marketing efficiency and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to increase efficiency and improve operational effectiveness across the Company. As a result of these initiatives and a near full recovery in travel bookings we have experienced increases in Adjusted EBITDA margins profitability and operating cash flows in excess of historic levels. For additional information about our business strategy for Expedia Group see the disclosure set forth in Part I. Item 1. Business under the caption “Market Opportunity and Business Strategy.” Online Travel Increased usage and familiarity with the internet have continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. Online penetration is higher in the U.S. and Western European markets with online penetration rates in some emerging markets such as Latin America and Eastern European regions lagging behind those regions. Emerging market online penetration rates increased through the COVID-19 pandemic and are expected to continue growing which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business while also attracting many competitors to online travel. This competition30/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 36/1182930/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 37/118Table of Contents intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as Google evidenced by continued product enhancements and prioritizing its own AdWords and metasearch products such as Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights in search results. Competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including Kayak.com (owned by Booking Holdings) trivago (in which Expedia Group owns a majority interest) as well as TripAdvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. Further airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. In addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. Businesses such as Airbnb Vrbo and Booking.com have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. Other competitors have arisen including vacation rental property managers such as Vacasa who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on Airbnb Vrbo and Booking.com and are expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market. Additionally traditional consumer ecommerce players have expanded their local offerings by adding hotel offers to their websites. Most recently ride sharing app Uber has added transportation and experience offerings to its app via partnerships with other travel providers. The online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in Europe. Expedia Group facilitates both merchant (Expedia Collect) and agency (Hotel Collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid ETP program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay Expedia Group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay. In 2022 we began evolving our strategy from being largely transactionally focused where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers through performance channels to building a direct relationship with our customers by allocating more marketing spend towards our loyalty programs paid app downloads and brand awareness. While we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands: Expedia Hotels.com and Vrbo. For more detail see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - \"We rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing” and “Our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally.” Lodging Lodging includes both hotel and alternative accommodations. As a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2022 lodging accounted for 76%. As a result of the impact on travel demand from the COVID-19 outbreak room nights stayed grew 29% in 2022 as compared to a growth of 35% in 2021 and a decline of 55% in 2020. ADRs for rooms stayed for Expedia Group increased 3% in 2020 increased 20% in 2021 and increased 7% in 2022. Over the last couple of years our lodging business saw a significant increase in ADRs compared to pre-pandemic levels which were driven by broader industry trends a mix shift to Vrbo and high ADR geographies. Vrbo carries a higher ADR than hotels and has accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery and shift to alternative accommodations during these periods. As of December 31 2022 our global lodging marketplace had approximately 3 million lodging properties available including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through Vrbo and approximately 900000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands. Hotel. We generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). Our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. As we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. These impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. Additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs discounting and couponing have contributed to declines in revenue per room night and profitability in certain cases. Since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in ADRs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. Strong pent-up demand and high operating costs during 2022 drove a 14% increase in the U.S. hotel industry ADRs versus 2019 according to Smith Travel Research (STR). In the future we could see macroeconomic factors influence hotel ADR trends including as the rising living costs due to inflation and higher interest rates. Other factors that could lead to moderating ADRs include growth in hotel supply and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory. Further while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. In the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings 3030/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 38/118Table of Contents on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty programs increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary benefits. Alternative Accommodations. With our acquisition of Vrbo (previously HomeAway) and all of its brands in December 2015 we expanded into the fast-growing alternative accommodations market. Vrbo is a leader in this market specializing in unique whole home inventory primarily in North American leisure markets and represents an attractive growth opportunity for Expedia Group. Vrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. Vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. It also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. Air Similar to the rest of travel the airlines experienced a surge in pent-up demand however they have been operating at reduced capacity due to staffing shortages supply chain disruptions and elevated fuel costs. In 2022 the reduced airline capacity and high operating costs drove average U.S. domestic airfares up approximately 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels according to Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) data. While air bookings improved in 2022 relative to 2021 our air business continues to lag lodging bookings and remains below 2019 levels. In addition we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine certain supply agreements renew and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets. Air ticket volumes increased 8% in 2022 and increased 43% during 2021 compared to a decline of 63% in 2020. As a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2022 air accounted for 3%. Advertising & Media Our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website and Expedia Group Media Solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. In 2022 we generated $777 million of advertising and media revenue a 29% increase from 2021 representing 7% of our total worldwide revenue. Since the onset of COVID-19 online travel agencies including ourselves have reduced marketing spend on trivago. In response trivago has reduced its own marketing spend and lowered operating costs to preserve profitability. We expect trivago to continue to experience revenue pressure going forward. Seasonality We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Since revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically Vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The growth in our B2B segment international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix among others may also influence the typical trend of seasonality in the future. Significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes from COVID- 19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings revenue profit and cash flows from 2020 through early 2022 but have generally returned to historic seasonality. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. 3130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 39/118Table of Contents We base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: •It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and •Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For more information on each of these policies see NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below. Accounting for Certain Merchant Revenue We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience. Actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior. Deferred Loyalty Rewards We currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers such as our Hotels.com Rewards program our Expedia Rewards program and our Orbitz Rewards program. Hotels.com Rewards offers travelers one free night at any Hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions. Expedia Rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on various Brand Expedia websites. Orbitz Rewards allows travelers to earn Orbucks the currency of Orbitz Rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those Orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. In 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called \"One Key\" spanning all our main brands which we expect to launch in 2023. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. In order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. We then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members\\' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. Revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. Both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors including fluctuations in reward value product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior. Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. During 2020 as a result of the significant turmoil related to COVID-19 we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit\\'s carrying amount over its fair value. Periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units except for trivago which is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying 3230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 40/11830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 41/118Table of Contents similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago\\'s stock price a Level 1 input adjusted for an estimated control premium. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2022 2021 and 2020 see NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. We account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. The first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority including resolution of any appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position meets the more 3330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 42/118Table of Contents likely than not criteria the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Other Long-Term Liabilities Various Legal and Tax Contingencies. We record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. In addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. In addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Occupancy and Other Taxes. Some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. Generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. In most jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. A limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. We are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe are similarly not liable for such taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. Certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future) which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. We note that there are more than 10000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. Rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. Certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant. Additionally certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation which is discussed in Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Occupancy and Other Taxes We are currently involved in eight lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. 3430/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 43/118Table of Contents For additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings see Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of $44 million as of December 31 2022 and $50 million as of December 31 2021. Certain jurisdictions including without limitation the states of New York New Jersey North Carolina Minnesota Oregon Rhode Island Maryland Pennsylvania Hawaii Iowa Massachusetts Arizona Wisconsin Idaho Arkansas Indiana Maine Nebraska Vermont Mississippi Virginia the city of New York and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. In addition in certain jurisdictions we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. We are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including without limitation the states of New York New Jersey South Carolina North Carolina Minnesota Georgia Wyoming West Virginia Oregon Rhode Island Montana Maryland Kentucky Maine Pennsylvania Hawaii Iowa Massachusetts Arizona Wisconsin Idaho Arkansas Indiana Nebraska Vermont Colorado Mississippi Virginia the city of New York and the District of Columbia as well as certain other jurisdictions. Pay-to-Play Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation for which a pay-to-play payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. However any significant pay-to-play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity. Other Jurisdictions. We are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities some of which including the City of Los Angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court. Segments We have the following reportable segments: Retail B2B and trivago. Our Retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com and Hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and Hotels.com websites throughout the world Vrbo Orbitz Travelocity Wotif Group ebookers CheapTickets Hotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment is comprised of Expedia Partner Solutions which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-party company branded websites and through its sale in November 2021 Egencia a full-service travel management company that provided travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. Operating Metrics Our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us. Gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. Revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

We do not agree with the position of the IRS. We have formally filed a protest for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and the case has been transferred to Appeals. During the fourth quarter of 2022 the IRS issued similar proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. The adjustments would increase our U.S. taxable income by $1.413 billion which would result in federal tax of approximately $494 million subject to interest. The proposed adjustments provided by the IRS exclude any offsetting adjustments that may reduce the amount of federal tax. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and intend to formally protest. We are also under examination by the IRS for our 2017-2020 years. We believe it is reasonably possible that the audit of the 2011 and 2013 tax years will conclude within the next 12 months. For more detail on our tax risk factors see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - \"A failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth” and “Application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities.” Definition and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA We report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the Legal Proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group Inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses net; (4) stock-based compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any; (6) certain other items including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related 4130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 51/118Table of Contents impacts Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. The reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Year ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group Inc. $ 352 $ 12 $ (2612) Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (9) 3 (116) Provision for income taxes 195 (53) (423) Total other expense net 547 224 432  Operating income (loss) 1085 186 (2719) Gain (loss) on revenue hedges related to revenue recognized (6) (17) 61  Restructuring and related reorganization charges — 55 231  Legal reserves occupancy tax and other 23 1 (13) Stock-based compensation 374 418 205  Depreciation and amortization 792 814 893  Impairment of goodwill — 14 799  Intangible and other long-term asset impairment 81 6 175  Adjusted EBITDA $ 2349 $ 1477 $ (368) Financial Position Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances which were $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31 2022 and 2021. Our revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion was essentially untapped at December 31 2022. As of December 31 2022 the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States was $770 million ($456 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $314 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). The amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the Unites States and for which future distributions could be taxable was $65 million as of December 31 2022. The unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $17 million as of December 31 2022. In 2022 we took the following action to reduce our debt outstanding: •Redemption of 2.5% Senior Notes. In March 2022 we early redeemed all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due in June 2022. The redemption price for the 2.5% senior notes equaled 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date. •Redemption of 3.6% and 4.5% Senior Notes. In May 2022 we early redeemed all of our $500 million 3.6% senior notes due 2023 and in June 2022 we early redeemed all of our $500 million 4.5% senior notes due 2024 which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million primarily comprised of “make-whole” premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. •Redemption of 2.95% Senior Notes. In September 2022 we settled the tender offer to purchase $500 million in aggregate principal of our 2.95% senior notes due 2031 for an aggregate cash repurchase price of approximately $418 million which resulted in the recognition of a net gain on debt extinguishment of $73 million. The net gain included the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs as well as related fees. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. As of December 31 2022 Moody’s rating was Baa3 with an outlook of “stable” S&P’s rating was BBB- with an outlook of “stable” and Fitch’s rating was BBB- with an outlook of “stable.” Changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. 4230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 52/118Table of Contents Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on our 6.25% senior notes 4.625% senior notes as well as our 2.95% senior notes will increase which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31 2022 we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in NOTE 7 — Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. For most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant lodging business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. Therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. Typically the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. Generally during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. During 2020 impacts of COVID-19 disrupted our typical working capital trends. Significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes particularly in the first half of 2020 resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. During 2022 booking and travel trends have nearly normalized resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period akin to typical historical trends. However it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters given the uncertainty related to the full duration and total impact of COVID-19. Prior to COVID-19 we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency. In response to COVID-19 we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from COVID-19 and continue to improve our long-term cost structure. For 2023 we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase relative to our 2022 spending levels as we look to continue to improve our technology platforms infrastructure operational capabilities and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations. Our cash flows are as follows:  Year ended December 31 $ Change  2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020  (In millions) Cash provided by (used in) operations: Operating activities $ 3440 $ 3748 $ (3834)$ (308)$ 7582  Investing activities (580) (931) (263) 351 (668) Financing activities (2624) (973) 4077 (1651) (5050) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(190) (177) 61 (13) (238) In 2022 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $308 million primarily due to a decrease in benefits from working capital changes driven mostly from a change in deferred merchant booking which was largely offset by higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation and amortization. In 2022 $351 million less cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net sales and maturities of investments of $145 million in 2022 compared to net purchases of investments of $178 million in 2021. Cash used in financing activities in 2022 primarily included payments of $2.2 billion related to the extinguishment of our 2.5% senior notes 3.6% senior notes 4.5% senior notes and the tender offer for a portion of our 2.95% senior notes discussed above as well as $607 million of cash paid to acquire shares including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments. These uses of cash were partially offset by $131 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. Cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately $2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and $1.2 billion for the redemption of preferred stock as well as $165 million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and $67 million in preferred stock dividends. These uses of cash were largely offset by approximately $2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 2.95% senior notes issued in February and March 2021 respectively as well as $503 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. Our Board of Directors and the Executive Committee pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs. These programs were temporarily halted in early 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in the second half of 2022. Shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as 4330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 53/118Table of Contents follows:  Year ended December 31  2022 2021 2020 Number of shares repurchased 5.2 million — 3.4 million Average price per share $ 96.09 $ — $ 109.88  Total cost of repurchases (in millions) $ 500 $ — $ 370   ______________________________________ (1) Amount excludes transaction costs. As of December 31 2022 18.1 million shares remain authorized for repurchase with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. During 2022 we didn\\'t pay any common stock dividends. During 2021 while we also didn\\'t pay common stock dividends we did pay $67 million (or $74.96 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. At this time we do not expect to make quarterly dividend payments on our common stock. Future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors. Foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in both 2022 and 2021 of $190 million and $177 million respectively reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during each year. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. Our material cash requirements as of December 31 2022 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business: •Principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. The Company had Senior Notes and Convertible Notes as described in NOTE 7 — Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of $6.3 billion none of which is payable within 12 months. Based on current stated fixed rates future interest payments associated with the Senior Notes total approximately $1.1 billion with approximately $231 million payable within 12 months; •Our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations including imputed interest of $443 million with $88 million payable within 12 months; and •Purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. The Company had purchase obligations of $466 million with $292 million payable within 12 months. In addition we had $284 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31 2022 for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of December 31 2022 related to letters of credit and guarantees. Other than the items described above we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31 2022. In our opinion our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs. There can be no assurance however that the cost or availability of future borrowings including refinancings if any will be available on terms acceptable to us.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt our revolving credit facilities derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31 2022 and 2021 the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $6.3 billion and $8.5 billion respectively. As of December 31 2022 the aggregate principal of our debt included: •$1.044 billion of senior unsecured notes due May 2025 that bear interest at 6.25%; •$750 million of senior unsecured notes due February 2026 that bear interest at 5.0%; •$1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due February 2026 with a fixed rate of 0% (the “Convertible Notes”); •$750 million of senior unsecured notes due August 2027 that bear interest at 4.625%; •$1 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2028 that bear interest at 3.8%; •$1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2030 that bear interest at 3.25%; and •$500 million of senior unsecured notes due March 2031 that bear interest at 2.95%. The 6.25% 5.0% 4.625% 3.8% 3.25% and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are collectively the “Senior Notes.” If market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. Additionally the 6.25% 4.625% and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards which would result in increased interest expense in the future. The total estimated fair value of our Senior Notes and Convertible Notes was approximately $5.8 billion and $9.2 billion as of December 31 2022 and December 31 2021 respectively. The fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $115 million. We maintain a revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in(1) (2) 4530/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 56/118Table of Contents interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of both December 31 2022 and 2021. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in certain international markets primarily in Australia Canada China the United Kingdom and the European Union. Because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. To the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. These instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net. As of December 31 2022 and 2021 we had net forward assets of $15 million and $3 million respectively included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges. In March 2022 we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (“the swaps”) with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million. The swaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. During the term of each contract we receive interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in Euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38%. The maturity date of both swaps is February 2026 whereby we will receive U.S. dollars from and pay Euros to the contract counterparties. The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $21 million asset as of December 31 2022 recorded in long-term investments and other assets. Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures. As an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $31 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31 2022. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period. During 2022 2021 and 2020 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $40 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $48 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) and net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $71 million ($2 million gain excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue). As we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors. These changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. Equity Investment Risk We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies investments in which we’ve elected the fair value option and minority investments without readily determinable fair values. We recorded net losses of $345 million $29 million and $142 million related to these investments for the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively (See NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information). The fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly- 4630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 57/118Table of Contents traded companies (combined with our investments in which we’ve elected the fair value option) and minority investments without readily determinable fair values were $564 million and $330 million respectively at December 31 2022 and $909 million and $330 million respectively at December 31 2021. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31 2022 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and minority investments without readily determinable fair values would have resulted in a loss before tax of approximately $89 million being recognized within other net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Controls and Procedures Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”) our management including our Chairman and Senior Executive Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation our Chairman and Senior Executive Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation management has concluded that as of December 31 2022 the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 as stated in their report which is included below. Limitations on Controls. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system no matter how well designed and operated is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Further no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the Company have been detected. 4730/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 58/118Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Expedia Group Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Expedia Group Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion Expedia Group Inc. (the Company) maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31 2022 and 2021 the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2022 and the related notes and our report dated February 9 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/Ernst & Young LLP Seattle Washington February 9 2023 4830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 59/118Table of Contents Part II.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expedia Group Inc. (the Company) as of December 31 2022 and 2021 the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2022 and the related notes(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion the consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company at December 31 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2022 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Loyalty Programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements travelers enrolled in the Expedia Rewards and Hotels.com Rewards loyalty programs (collectively “loyalty programs”) earn reward points with each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. Member consideration is allocated between travel services and reward points earned in the loyalty programs. The Company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned reward points net of rewards not expected to be redeemed (known as “breakage”) as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. To estimate the relative standalone selling price for reward points the Company considers the stated redemption value per point dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of reward points based on statistical modeling techniques using historical member activity. The deferred loyalty rewards balance net of amounts paid to the travel suppler is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased with the loyalty reward is satisfied.    F- 230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 68/118Table of Contents Auditing the Company’s deferred loyalty rewards balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant measurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of reward points. Management uses statistical modeling techniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. The amount of member consideration allocated to the reward points earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption. Changes in loyalty program terms or the method or manner in which reward points can be redeemed by members can change member behavior which increases the measurement uncertainty as historical member activity may not be indicative of future behavior.  How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over Management’s review of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates. We also tested controls over the completeness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. This included controls over the Company’s systems and the application controls involved in the process to track loyalty reward member activity.   To test the deferred loyalty rewards balance we performed audit procedures that included among others involving our actuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by Management and to develop an independent actuarial estimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. We then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the Company’s estimates. Additionally we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our actuarial specialists in their breakage analyses. Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the Company records a valuation allowance based on the assessment of the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. For the year ended December 31 2022 the Company recorded deferred tax assets of $1343 million and a related valuation allowance of $242 million.   Auditing management’s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets is complex because management’s projection of future taxable income includes forward-looking assumptions that are inherently judgmental because they may be affected by future market or other economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over Management’s review of the realizability of deferred tax assets. This included controls over management’s evaluation of the sources of future taxable income.   We tested the assumptions used by the Company to develop the anticipated future earnings used in the Company’s analysis in determining the valuation allowance. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s projections. For example we evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the future projected financial information as well as management’s consideration of current operating industry and economic trends. We also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 — Organization and Basis of Presentation Description of Business Expedia Group Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. These travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands including: Brand Expedia® Hotels.com® Expedia® Partner Solutions Vrbo® trivago® Orbitz® Travelocity® Hotwire® Wotif® ebookers® CheapTickets® Expedia Group™ Media Solutions CarRentals.com™ and Expedia Cruises™. In addition many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to Expedia Group Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia Group” the “Company” “us” “we” and “our” in these consolidated financial statements. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain the virus had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition. With the evolution of milder COVID-19 variants availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus many COVID-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel. Overall the full duration and total impact of COVID- 19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and in particular our business going forward. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Expedia Group Inc. our wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities we control or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We record our investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method or at fair value. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts. We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. However these consolidated financial statements do not present our future financial position the results of our future operations and cash flows. Seasonality We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Since revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically Vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. Significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes from COVID-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings revenue profit and cash flows from 2020 through early 2022 but have generally returned to historic seasonality. NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Expedia Group Inc. our wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities for which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding common stock. We record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and therefore is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to Expedia Group Inc. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements. F- 1030/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 78/118Table of Contents Accounting Estimates We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. Our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes such as potential settlements related to occupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses customer refunds and chargebacks. Reclassifications We have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. For our primary transaction-based revenue sources discussed below we have determined net presentation (that is the amount billed to a traveler less the amount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel services and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. We exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority if any from the measurement of transaction prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the Company from customers (which are therefore excluded from revenue). We offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model. Under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings. Under the agency model we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for such bookings. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. For certain agency airline hotel and car transactions we also receive fees through global distribution systems (“GDS”) that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and through which reservations are booked. Under the advertising model we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites. In addition Vrbo also provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers. The nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we provide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. We consider both the traveler and travel supplier as our customers. Refer to NOTE 18 — Segment Information for revenue by business model and service type. Lodging. Our lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant agency and Vrbo subscription-based listing services model. Merchant Hotel. We provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night occurs at which point we recognize the revenue net of amounts paid to suppliers as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. Payments to suppliers are generally due within 30 days of check-in or stay. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience. Cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier if applicable. F- 1130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 79/118Table of Contents Agency Hotel. We generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. We record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. Merchant and Agency Vrbo Alternative Accommodations. Vrbo\\'s lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-booking basis which can be either merchant or agency bookings depending on the nature of the payment processor. Pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and managers bear the inventory risk have latitude in setting the price and compensate Vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. Under pay-per-booking arrangements each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue net of amounts paid to property owners is recognized at check in which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete. Vrbo also charges a traveler service fee at the time of booking. The service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for Vrbo\\'s services including but not limited to the use of Vrbo\\'s website and a “Book with Confidence Guarantee” providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and 24/7 traveler support. The performance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and as such the traveler service fee revenue is recognized at check-in. Subscription-based Listing Services. To a lesser extent Vrbo\\'s lodging revenue is also earned on a pay-per-subscription basis. In pay- per-subscription contracts property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year). As the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period the pay-per-subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period. Merchant and Agency Air. We record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. We record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. In certain transactions the GDS collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these commissions to us net of their fees. Therefore we view payments through the GDS as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue. Fees paid to the GDS as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue. Advertising and Media. We record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners’ websites. We record revenue for advertising placements ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions depending on the terms of the contract. Payments from advertisers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing. Other. Other primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car cruise and destination services under the agency business model. We generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance obligation is complete. Additionally no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. We record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. Revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or when we provide the service. In addition other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model for which revenue is recorded at the time the transaction is booked. Packages. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air car or destination services component. The individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above. Prepaid Merchant Bookings. We classify payments made to suppliers in advance of Vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included within prepaid and other current assets. Prepaid merchant bookings was $480 million as of December 31 2022 and $591 million as of December 31 2021. Deferred Merchant Bookings. We classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings. At December 31 2021 $4.9 billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings $4.0 billion of which was recognized resulting in $693 million of revenue during the year ended December 31 2022 with the remainder primarily consisting of cancellations during the year. At December 31 2022 the related balance was $6.2 billion. Travelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn points for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. Hotels.com Rewards offers travelers one free night at any Hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions. Expedia Rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on various Brand Expedia websites. Orbitz Rewards allows travelers to earn Orbucks the currency of Orbitz Rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those Orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty F- 1230/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 80/11830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 81/118Table of Contents rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. In order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. We then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members\\' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. Revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. The majority of rewards expected to be redeemed are recognized within one to two years of being earned. At December 31 2021 $798 million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31 2022. At December 31 2022 the related balance was $961 million. Deferred Revenue. Deferred revenue primarily consists of unearned subscription revenue as well as deferred advertising revenue. At December 31 2021 $166 million was recorded as deferred revenue $117 million of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31 2022. At December 31 2022 the related balance was $163 million. Practical Expedients and Exemptions. We have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar characteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. Using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. However we will continue to assess and refine if necessary how a portfolio within each rewards program is defined. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. Cash Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments including money market funds and term deposit investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. Our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases. The following table reconciles cash cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows: December 31 2022 2021 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 4096 $ 4111  Restricted cash and cash equivalents 1755 1694  Total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows$ 5851 $ 5805  Short-term and Long-term Investments We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. Investments other than minority equity investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments if any are determined on a specific identification basis. Investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. All other investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets. Minority equity investments with either readily determinable fair values or for which we have elected to apply the fair value option are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through net income or loss. Minority investments without readily determinable fair values for which we have not elected to measure at fair value are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income or loss. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value of minority equity investments are recorded in other income (expense) net. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. The risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools primarily include the type of receivable (for example credit F- 1330/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 82/118Table of Contents card vs hotel collect) collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For each pool we make estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due previous loss history continually updated for new collections data the credit quality of our customers current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The provision for estimated credit losses is recorded as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. We expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is three to five years for computer equipment capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment 15 years for land improvements and 40 years for buildings which includes our corporate headquarters. Land is not depreciated. We amortize leasehold improvement using the straight- line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets accrued expenses and other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For operating leases with a term of one year or less we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Instead we recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. We have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Business Combinations We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates. Any changes to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets neither of which is amortized for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the F- 1430/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 83/118Table of Contents reporting unit to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit\\'s carrying amount over its fair value. Periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units except for trivago which is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value of the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago\\'s stock price a Level 1 input adjusted for an estimated control premium. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. In our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value if necessary. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relief-from- royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. As with goodwill periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired. Recoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to ten years. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups including property and equipment to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Assets held for sale to the extent we have any are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us F- 1530/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 84/11830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 85/118Table of Contents for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. We account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. The first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority including resolution of any appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line in our consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In relation to tax effects for accumulated OCI our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. Any remaining tax effect in accumulated OCI is released following a portfolio approach. We account for the global intangible low-tax income earned by our foreign subsidiaries included in gross U.S. taxable income in the period incurred. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date. At December 31 2022 and 2021 our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment we classify the changes in their fair value in other net. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Until their redemption in March 2022 the aggregate principal value of our €650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that bore interest at 2.5% (the “2.5% Notes”) was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries. The notes were measured at Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates were recorded in accumulated OCI within the foreign currency translation adjustment. The Euro denominated net assets of these subsidiaries were translated into U.S. Dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated OCI. In March 2022 we redeemed the 2.5% Notes and terminated the related hedging relationship. The currency translation adjustment amounts associated with the net investment hedge of the 2.5% Notes will remain in accumulated OCI until realized upon a full or partial sale or liquidation of applicable Euro-functional currency subsidiaries. In March 2022 we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (the “swaps”) with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million. During the term of each contract we receive interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in Euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38% based on a notional amount and fixed interest rates determined at contract inception. The swaps were designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Hedge effectiveness is assessed each quarter based on the net investment in the foreign subsidiaries designated as the hedged item and the changes in the fair value of the designated interest rate swaps based on spot rates. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements changes in fair value are recorded as accumulated OCI within the foreign currency translation adjustment. Amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness at inception are recognized as interest accrues within interest expense. The maturity date of both swaps is February 2026 whereby we will receive U.S. dollars from and pay Euros to the contract counterparties. Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses Certain of our operations outside of the United States use the related local currency as their functional currency. We translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of F- 1630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 86/118Table of Contents exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions. To the extent practicable we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally as discussed above we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. Debt Issuance Costs We defer costs we incur to issue debt which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders over the term of the redemption option. Marketing Promotions We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally our incentive offers are as follows: Current Discount Offers. These promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction. Inducement Offers. These promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount at the time of the offer between the current performance obligation and the potential future performance obligations based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Concession Offers. These promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. Upon issuance we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for concession offers. Advertising Expense We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs including television and radio advertising and online advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g. television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020 our advertising expense was $3.9 billion $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion. Stock-Based Compensation We measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options as follows: Restricted Stock Units. RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests typically over a four-year period but may accelerate in certain circumstances. We measure the value of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value net of actual forfeitures as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. In addition we have a limited number of performance stock units (\"PSUs\") for which we calculate the fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model and amortized the fair value net of actual forfeitures as stock-based compensation over the vesting term generally a two or three year period on an accelerated basis. The number of shares that ultimately vest depends on achieving certain performance metrics or performance goals as applicable by the end of the performance period assuming there is no accelerated vesting for among other things a termination of employment under certain circumstances. We record RSUs that may be settled by the holder in cash rather than shares as a liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount which is based on our stock price on the settlement date. Stock Options. Our employee stock options consist of service based awards. We measure the value of stock options issued or modified including unvested options assumed in acquisitions on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates if applicable) at fair value using appropriate valuation techniques including the Black-Scholes. We amortize the fair value net30/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 87/118F- 1730/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 88/118Table of Contents of actual forfeitures over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. In addition we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time. Such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount. The majority of our stock options vest over three to four years. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. Earnings Per Share We compute basic earnings per share by taking net income or loss attributable to Expedia Group Inc. available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments (which includes our Convertible Notes) using the treasury stock or the if converted method as applicable. For additional information on how we compute earnings per share see NOTE 12 — Earnings Per Share. Fair Value Recognition Measurement and Disclosure The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. The accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale. We disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. Certain Risks and Concentrations Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers primarily airlines and hotels dependence on third-party technology providers exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. We also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services. Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in U.S. dollars Euros British pound Canadian dollar Australian dollar Brazilian real Swiss Franc and Indian Rupee. Contingent Liabilities We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding as discussed further in NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies. Periodically we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. F- 1830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 89/118Table of Contents Occupancy and Other Taxes Some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. Generally hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. In most jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such taxes. A limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. We are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes when determined to be probable and estimable. See NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. Recently Adopted Accounting Policies In June 2022 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance related to fair value measurement of equity securities which clarifies the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2023 with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the second quarter of 2022 on a prospective basis. One of our minority equity investments is accounted for in accordance with this new guidance See NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Recent Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted In October 2021 the FASB issued new guidance relate to recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The new guidance will require acquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as compared to current GAAP where an acquirer generally recognizes such items at fair value on the acquisition date. The new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2022 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect it will have a material impact if any on our consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets a Level 2 input. Valuation of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is based on foreign currency exchange rates and the current interest rate curve Level 2 inputs. We hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. Term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments and those with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified within long-term investments and other assets. As of December 31 2022 and 2021 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits money market funds and mutual funds with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. As of December 31 2022 we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $2.8 billion. As of December 31 2022 and 2021 we had net forward assets of $15 million ($29 million gross forward asset) and $3 million ($12 million gross forward asset) recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets. We recorded $(66) million $1 million and $74 million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2022 2021 and 2020. On March 2 2022 we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million and maturity dates of February 2026. The swaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $21 million asset as of December 31 2022 recorded in long-term investments and other assets and the gain recognized in interest expense during the year ended December 31 2022 was $5 million. Our equity investments include our marketable equity investment in Despegar a publicly traded company which is included in long- term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020 we recognized losses of approximately $45 million $29 million and $6 million respectively within other net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment. In connection with our disposition of Egencia (our former corporate travel arm) in November 2021 as discussed in NOTE 16 – Divestitures we became an indirect holder of approximately 19% interest in GBT JerseyCo Ltd. (“GBT”) doing business as American Express Global Business Travel with an initial fair value of $815 million. As we elected the fair value option for our investment during the first quarter of 2022 we recorded a downward adjustment of approximately $2 million based on an updated valuation. In May 2022 GBT completed a deSPAC business combination with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. This combination resulted in a newly publicly traded company Global Business Travel Group Inc (“GBTG”) which together with GBT’s pre-combination shareholders owned all of GBT. Post combination and as of December 31 2022 we had an approximately 16% ownership interest in GBT and a commensurate voting interest in GBTG. Our shares in GBT are exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for GBTG shares and as such we valued our investment based on the GBTG’s share price as of F- 2030/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 92/118Table of Contents the last trading day in 2022 which resulted in a loss of $300 million within other net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31 2022. The following table reconciles in millions the beginning and ending balances of our Level 3 assets. With the May 2022 business combination of GBTG we reclassified our equity investment from a Level 3 asset to a Level 2 asset.

Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other net on our consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill. During 2021 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million in our B2B segment resulting from valuing a component of our Egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on November 1 2021. During 2020 due to the severe and persistent negative effect COVID-19 had on global economies the travel industry and our business as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery in addition to our annual assessment on October 1 2020 we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill. As a result of assessments during 2020 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million of which $559 million related to our Retail segment primarily our Vrbo reporting unit and $240 million related to our trivago segment. Our assessments compared the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. The fair value estimates for all reporting units except trivago were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account operating result trends the anticipated duration of COVID-19 impacts and rates of recovery and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago’s stock price a Level 1 input adjusted for an estimated control premium. The excess of the reporting unit\\'s carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as goodwill impairment charges during 2020. As of December 31 2020 the applicable reporting units within our Retail segment had $2.3 billion goodwill remaining after the impairments incurred in 2020 and our trivago segment had $337 million goodwill remaining. As noted above trivago is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements and therefore assesses goodwill at a lower level which could result in possible differences in the ultimate amount or timing of impairments recognized. Additionally as the stock of our trivago segment is publicly traded it is difficult to predict market dynamics and the extent or duration of any stock price declines. Intangible and Long-term Assets. During 2022 we recognized intangible impairment charges of $81 million related to an indefinite- lived trade name within our trivago segment that primarily resulted from changes in the weighted average cost of capital. The indefinite- lived trade name asset classified as Level 3 measurements was valued using the relief-from-royalty method which includes unobservable inputs including projected revenues royalty rates and weighted average cost of capital. During 2021 we recognized long-term asset impairment charges of $6 million in our B2B segment resulting from the write-off of capitalized software of a component of our Egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on November 1 2021. During 2020 we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $175 million within our Retail segment of which $119 million related to indefinite-lived trade names that resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands as well as $35 million related to definite-lived intangible assets and $21 million related to other long-lived assets. The indefinite-lived intangible assets classified as Level 3 measurements were valued using the relief-from-royalty method which includes unobservable inputs including projected revenues and royalty rates which ranged from 2% to 8% with a weighted average royalty rate of 7%. For definite-lived intangible assets classified as Level 3 measurements we compared the estimated F- 2130/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 93/11830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 94/118Table of Contents future net undiscounted cash flows which included key inputs such as rates of growth and profitability of our business as well as incremental net working capital to the long-lived asset’s carrying amount. During 2020 we met the criteria to recognize certain smaller businesses within our Retail segment as held-for-sale. As such we remeasured the disposal groups at fair value less costs to sell which is considered a Level 3 measurement and was based on each transaction’s estimated consideration as of the date of close. Minority Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values. As of both December 31 2022 and 2021 the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $330 million. During 2022 and 2021 we had no material gains or losses recognized related to these minority investments. During 2020 we recorded $134 million of losses related to a minority investment which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. As of December 31 2022 total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $2 million in unrealized upward adjustments and $105 million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).

During 2021 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million. During 2020 due to the severe and persistent negative effect COVID-19 had on global economies the travel industry and our business as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery in addition to our annual assessment we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill and intangible assets.

Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an index rate plus a margin (a) in the case of term benchmark loans ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum depending on Expedia Group\\'s credit ratings and (b) in the case of base rate loans ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum depending on Expedia Group\\'s credit ratings. A fee is payable quarterly in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility at a rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25% per annum depending on Expedia Group\\'s credit ratings. The terms of the revolving credit facility require Expedia Group to not exceed a specified maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The revolving credit facility has a $120 million letter of credit (“LOC”) sublimit and the amount of LOCs issued under the facility reduced the credit amount available. As of December 31 2022 there was $38 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facility. The current facility was setup in April 2022 and Expedia Group terminated all outstanding commitments and repaid all outstanding obligations under our prior $1.145 billion revolving credit facility and $855 million foreign credit facility. As of December 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under either prior facility and $14 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the $1.145 billion revolving facility.

The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $106 million $157 million and $44 million for 2022 2021 and 2020. We capitalized $54 million $68 million and $36 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the cost of developing internal-use software in 2022 2021 and 2020. Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020 was $98 million $476 million and $301 million respectively. Total current income tax benefits during the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020 associated with the exercise of stock-based awards held by our employees were $17 million $28 million and $1 million respectively. As of December 31 2022 there was approximately $938 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards which is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of 2.73 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) which allows shares of our common stock to be purchased by eligible employees at three-month intervals at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period.

U.S. federal NOLs of $1.1 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. State NOLs of $103 million may be carried forward indefinitely and state NOLs of $362 million expire at various times starting from 2025. Foreign NOLs of $188 million may be carried forward indefinitely and foreign NOLs of $80 million expire at various times starting from 2023. As of December 31 2022 we had a valuation allowance of approximately $242 million related to certain tax attribute carryforwards for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. The valuation allowance increased by $71 million from the amount recorded as of December 31 2021 primarily due to the unrealized capital losses on minority investments offset by use of net operating losses. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable may be adjusted if capital gains are realized or if in certain jurisdictions objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative GAAP losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. The majority of our foreign undistributed earnings have already been subject to U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31 2022 we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $65 million that are considered indefinitely reinvested and we estimate that the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal state and foreign income tax consequences of these earnings was $17 million.

Our effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation release of valuation allowance and research and experimentation credits partially offset by nondeductible compensation measured against a pre-tax loss. Our effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to valuation allowances and nondeductible impairments measured against a pre-tax loss.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently examining Expedia Group’s U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for the periods ended December 31 2011 through December 31 2020. The Company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations until June 30 2024 related to the 2011 through 2013 tax years and until March 31 2024 related to the 2014 through 2019 tax years. As of December 31 2022 for the Expedia Group Inc. and Subsidiaries group statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2021 remain open to examination in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. For the HomeAway and Orbitz groups the tax years 2001 through 2015 remain subject to examination in the U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions due to NOL carryforwards. During the fourth quarter of 2019 the IRS issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years. The adjustments would increase our U.S. taxable income by $696 million which would result in U.S. federal tax of approximately $244 million subject to interest. We do not agree with the position of the IRS. We have formally filed a protest for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and the case has been transferred to Appeals. During the fourth quarter of 2022 the IRS issued similar proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. The adjustments would increase our U.S. taxable income by $1.413 billion which would result in federal tax of approximately $494 million subject to interest. The proposed adjustments provided by the IRS exclude any offsetting adjustments that may reduce the amount of federal tax. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and intend to formally protest. We believe it is reasonably possible that audit of the 2011 and 2013 tax years will conclude within the next 12 months.

For the year ended December 31 2021 approximately 11 million of outstanding stock-based awards and approximately four million shares related to the potential share settlement impact related to our Convertible Notes were excluded. For the year ended December 31 2020 approximately 22 million of outstanding stock-based awards and common stock warrants were excluded. The earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation. NOTE 13 — Restructuring and Related Reorganization Charges In 2020 we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations.

The following table presents these commitments and obligations as of December 31 2022:   By Period  TotalLess than  1  year1 to 3  years3 to 5  yearsMore than  5  years  (In millions) Purchase obligations $ 466 $ 292 $ 144 $ 30 $ —  Guarantees 27 27 — — —  Letters of credit 44 42 2 — —  $ 537 $ 361 $ 146 $ 30 $ —  Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. We have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries’ aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery by us of packaged travel sold in those countries. The authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. Our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.  Our LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs underwritten by a group of lenders which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above. There were no material claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended December 31 2022 2021 and 2020. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of Expedia Group. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters including value-added tax excise tax sales tax transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results; however litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Litigation Relating to Occupancy Taxes. One hundred three lawsuits have been filed by or against cities counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. Eight lawsuits are currently active. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. To date forty-nine of these lawsuits have been dismissed. Some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and generally allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Thirty-four dismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. As a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of $44 million and $50 million as of December 31 2022 and 2021 respectively. Our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. Changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations. Pay-to-Play. Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are F- 3630/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 111/11830/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 112/118Table of Contents made we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation for which a pay-to-play payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. We are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities some of which including in the City of Los Angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court. Matters Relating to International VAT. We are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of VAT to our European Union related transactions. While we believe we comply with applicable VAT laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. In certain jurisdictions including the United Kingdom we may be required to “pay-to-play” any VAT assessment prior to contesting its validity. While we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made. Competition and Consumer Matters. On August 23 2018 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or \"ACCC\" instituted proceedings in the Australian Federal Court against trivago. The ACCC alleged breaches of Australian Consumer Law or \"ACL\" relating to trivago’s advertisements in Australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s Australian site trivago’s strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago\\'s Australian website. On January 20 2020 the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the ACL. On October 18 and 19 2021 the court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders. On April 22 2022 the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment ordering trivago to pay a penalty of AU$44.7 million which was paid in the second quarter of 2022 and to cover the ACCC’s costs arising from the proceedings. The court also enjoined trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the Australian Federal Court to be in contravention of the ACL. We recorded an estimated loss of approximately $11 million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period and an additional loss of approximately $23 million during the first quarter of 2022 for a total of approximately $34 million previously included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of March 31 2022. NOTE 16 – Divestitures We had no disposition activity during 2022. On November 1 2021 we completed the sale of Egencia Expedia Group’s corporate travel arm included within our B2B segment to GBT. As a result of the sale we deconsolidated Egencia recognized a gain of $401 million within gain (loss) on sale of business net in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31 2021 and divested cash and restricted cash of $88 million. We received no cash for this transaction but on the date of sale Expedia Group became an indirect holder of an approximately 19% interest of GBT with an initial fair value of $815 million and a subsidiary entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with GBT. During the year ended December 31 2022 we recognized an immaterial gain of approximately $6 million related to this transaction. See NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information on our ongoing investment. In addition during 2020 and 2021 in connection with our efforts to focus on our core businesses and streamline our activities we committed to plans to divest certain smaller businesses primarily within our Retail segment. As a result in 2020 we completed the sale of certain smaller businesses including Bodybuilding.com and SilverRail which combined resulted in a net losses of $13 million and net cash divested of $21 million. In 2021 we completed additional sales including Classic Vacations and Alice which combined resulted in net gains of $57 million and net cash received of $27 million. The resulting gains and losses in these transactions were recorded within gain (loss) on sale of business net in the consolidated statement of operations. None of these dispositions were considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and they did not represent individually significant components of our business; therefore they have not been reported as discontinued operations. NOTE 17 — Related Party Transactions IAC/InterActiveCorp The Company and IAC are related parties because Mr. Diller serves as Chairman and Senior Executive of both Expedia Group and IAC. At December 31 2022 each of Expedia Group and IAC has a 50% ownership interest in two aircraft that may be used by both companies. Members of the aircraft flight crews are employed by an entity in which the Company and IAC each have a 50% ownership interest. The Company and IAC have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation F- 3730/5/23 20:41 expe-20221231 https://www .sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442423000007/expe-20221231.htm 113/118Table of Contents and benefits pro-rata according to each company’s respective usage of the aircraft for which they are separately billed by the entity described above. We share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the aircraft; direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. Another aircraft that had previously been jointly-owned by the companies was sold in November 2022 with each company receiving 50% of the $19 million in net sale proceeds. In addition in December 2021 we entered into agreements pursuant to which we may use additional aircraft owned by a subsidiary of IAC on a cost basis. Total payments made to this entity by the Company were not material. As of December 31 2022 and 2021 the net basis in our ownership interest in the aircrafts then jointly-owned was $46 million and $60 million respectively recorded in long-term investments and other assets. In 2022 2021 and 2020 operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the aircraft were not material. NOTE 18 — Segment Information We have the following reportable segments: Retail B2B and trivago. Our Retail segment which consists of the aggregation of operating segments provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com and Hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and Hotels.com websites throughout the world Vrbo Orbitz Travelocity Wotif Group ebookers CheapTickets Hotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment is comprised of Expedia Partner Solutions which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third- party company branded websites and Egencia (until its sale in November 2021) a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. We determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our Retail and B2B segments includes allocations of certain expenses primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform as well as facility costs and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting human resources certain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. Our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our Retail segment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties and therefore impact segment performance. However the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within Corporate and Eliminations in the table below. Corporate and Eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses as well as Bodybuilding.com through its sale in May 2020. In addition we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment as well as stock-based compensation expense restructuring and related reorganization charges legal reserves occupancy tax and other and other items excluded from segment operating performance in Corporate and Eliminations. Such amounts are detailed in our segment reconciliation below.

As a significant portion of our property and equipment is not allocated to our operating segments and depreciation is not included in our segment measure we do not report the assets by segment as it would not be meaningful. We do not regularly provide such information to our chief operating decision makers.
